Instructions:This is a CDK JAVA project.
Ignore any files inside the archive/ folder.
Main infrastructure code is in lib/src/main/java/app/Main.java 
Test code is in the tests folder. tests/unit/java/app/MainTest.java and tests/integration/java/app/MainIntegrationTest.java
All the requirementsare in lib/PROMPT.md.
Your job is to check weather all the requirements are covers in our Main.java file or not, 
The language and platform are also confirmed in metadata.json as JAVA, 


 What this is

- A CDK JAVA project where **all infrastructure code lives in one file**: `Main.java`.


 
---

Task1: Ensure that the infrastructure in lib/src/main/java/app/Main.java  fully covers all the requirements in lib/PROMPT.md. If the current code does not satisfy the requirements, fix it before proceeding. Wrte a code for complete requirements:
Consideration: make sure code follow least permissions in roles/policies. do not use * or wildcard. Make sure code follows proper depends_on and relationship between each resources. Make sure we follow security and compliance in all resources creation, like in s3 bucket enalble versioning, encryption, block public access and so on...
Ensure that the code is well-structured, follows best practices, and is easy to understand. 
Ensure that the code is modular, with clear separation of concerns.

Before Task 2: Fully understand the CI CD pipeline under .github folder (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)
We have to complete Build Job / Testing jobs like unit and live integration test and deployment jobs so undetstand it

Task2: Build Job: Ensure the build step completes successfully

Task3: Write and build unit tests that are 100 percentage coverage and passing fully.
Consideration: code is in tests folder for java. 
```
I need comprehensive Unit tests based on below information
1. I have main.java file available inside lib directory and directory name should be read as lib/src/main/java/app/Main.java  
2. It should validate components based on user requirements.
3. I need test cases in tests java files
```

Task4: Write and build integration tests that are 100 percentage coverage and passing fully. integration tests using mock outputs if needed (e.g., before deployment or if cfn-outputs are missing).
Consideration code is in tests folder
```
Integration tests should not apply any init or deploy commands.
They must run using live AWS read-only checks, driven by the CI/CD outputs file
Our CI/CD pipeline generates a JSON file for resource outputs under the deploy stage called "Get Deployment Outputs".
That JSON file is saved at cfn-outputs/all-outputs.json — use this path in tests.

I need integration tests based on below information:
1. avoid running init or apply commands
2. I need test cases in java

```

Task5: Make sure Lint and Synt jobs/test is passing.

Task6: Generate the Ideal Response MD file content at ./lib/IDEAL_RESPONSE.nd,  
Rules for IDEAL_RESPONSE.md: Ideal response file should have ```java and complete code in Main.java ``` 
After the solution is ready, and changes are made in code, 
copy it into Ideal response file. And then generate MODEL_FAILURES.md file 
by compare ideal response with model response files. 
Document all differences in lib/MODEL_FAILURES.md.Task7: 
Markdown Linting verification: Run markdownlint on all .md files in the lib/ folder. 
Rules: Must be self-contained (do not reference other .md files).
