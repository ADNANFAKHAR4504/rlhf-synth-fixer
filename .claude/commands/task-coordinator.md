# Task Coordinator

Orchestrates the complete Infrastructure as Code development lifecycle by coordinating three specialized sub-agents.

## Workflow

Execute these phases in sequence to deliver production-ready IaC:

### Phase 1: Task Selection

**Agent**: `iac-task-selector`

### Phase 2: Code Generation

**Agent**: `iac-infra-generator`

### Phase 3: QA Training & Validation

**Agent**: `iac-infra-qa-trainer`

### Phase 4: Code Review & Compliance

**Agent**: `iac-code-reviewer`

- If the `lib/MODEL_FAILURES.md` file reports minimal issues (not big deployment issues deploying the MODEL_RESPONSE), 
  then request iac-infra-generator to add two more recent AWS Features or services to increase the complexity of the
  task. Then go to phase2 and give it another round. The idea of this is to make sure that we are truly finding flaws 
  in the initial `lib/MODEL_RESPONSE.md` and fix them in the `lib/IDEAL_RESPONSE.md`.

### Phase 5: PR Creation & Task Completion

**Agent**: `task-coordinator` (orchestrates final steps)

**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 (code-reviewer) reports "Ready"

**Steps**:

1. **Verify you're in worktree directory**:
   ```bash
   pwd  # Should end with: /worktree/synth-{task_id}
   ```

2. **Stage all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git status  # Review what will be committed
   ```

3. **Commit with standardized message**:
   ```bash
   # Extract metadata for commit message
   TASK_ID=$(jq -r '.po_id' metadata.json)
   SUBTASK=$(jq -r '.subtask' metadata.json)
   PLATFORM=$(jq -r '.platform' metadata.json)
   LANGUAGE=$(jq -r '.language' metadata.json)
   COMPLEXITY=$(jq -r '.complexity' metadata.json)
   TRAINING_QUALITY=$(jq -r '.training_quality' metadata.json)
   
   git commit -m "feat(iac): Task ${TASK_ID} - ${SUBTASK}

Platform: ${PLATFORM}-${LANGUAGE}
Complexity: ${COMPLEXITY}
Training Quality: ${TRAINING_QUALITY}/10

Auto-generated by Claude Agent
Task ID: ${TASK_ID}"
   ```

4. **Push branch to remote**:
   ```bash
   BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
   git push origin ${BRANCH_NAME}
   ```

5. **Create PR using gh CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Get AWS services count
   AWS_SERVICES_COUNT=$(jq -r '.aws_services | length' metadata.json)
   
   gh pr create \
     --title "Task ${TASK_ID}: ${SUBTASK}" \
     --body "**Platform**: ${PLATFORM}-${LANGUAGE}
**Complexity**: ${COMPLEXITY}
**Training Quality**: ${TRAINING_QUALITY}/10
**AWS Services**: ${AWS_SERVICES_COUNT} services

Auto-generated infrastructure task.

Task ID: ${TASK_ID}" \
     --base main \
     --head ${BRANCH_NAME} \
     --label "automated" \
     --label "complexity-${COMPLEXITY}"
   ```

6. **Capture PR number**:
   ```bash
   PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view ${BRANCH_NAME} --json number -q .number)
   echo "✅ Created PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
   ```

7. **Update CSV status to "done"**:
   ```bash
   # Return to main repo to update CSV
   cd ../..
   
   # Update tasks.csv (using Python for safe CSV handling)
   python3 << 'PYTHON_SCRIPT'
import csv
import sys

task_id = "${TASK_ID}"
pr_number = "${PR_NUMBER}"

# Read CSV
rows = []
updated = False
with open('tasks.csv', 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    fieldnames = reader.fieldnames
    for row in reader:
        if row['task_id'] == task_id and row['status'] == 'in_progress':
            row['status'] = 'done'
            row['trainr_notes'] = f"Completed - PR #{pr_number}"
            updated = True
        rows.append(row)

# Write back
if updated:
    with open('tasks.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(rows)
    print(f"✅ Updated task {task_id} status to 'done'")
else:
    print(f"⚠️ Task {task_id} not found or not in 'in_progress' status")
    sys.exit(1)
PYTHON_SCRIPT
   ```

8. **Cleanup worktree**:
   ```bash
   # Remove worktree (keeps branch for PR)
   git worktree remove worktree/synth-${TASK_ID} --force
   
   # Verify cleanup
   git worktree list
   echo "✅ Worktree cleaned up. Branch synth-${TASK_ID} remains for PR."
   ```

9. **Final validation**:
   ```bash
   # Verify PR was created
   gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json state,url,title
   
   # Verify worktree is cleaned up
   if [ ! -d "worktree/synth-${TASK_ID}" ]; then
     echo "✅ Cleanup successful"
   else
     echo "⚠️ Worktree directory still exists"
   fi
   ```

**Note**: Branch `synth-{task_id}` remains active for the PR. GitHub will auto-delete it after PR merge.


### Setup Worktree

**CRITICAL: Strict worktree structure enforcement**

1. **Create git worktree with EXACT naming convention**:
   ```bash
   # REQUIRED format - do not deviate from this:
   git worktree add worktree/synth-{task_id} -b synth-{task_id}
   ```
   
   **Naming Rules**:
   - Directory: MUST be `worktree/synth-{task_id}` (with forward slash)
   - Branch: MUST be `synth-{task_id}` (matching the directory name)
   - ❌ WRONG: `worktree-synth-{task_id}`, `worktrees/`, `worktree-{task_id}`, `IAC-synth-{task_id}`
   - ✅ CORRECT: `worktree/synth-{task_id}`

2. **Immediately change to worktree directory**:
   ```bash
   cd worktree/synth-{task_id}
   ```
   
   **From this point forward, ALL commands run from this directory unless explicitly stated otherwise.**

3. **Validate worktree setup before proceeding**:
   ```bash
   # Verify correct location
   pwd  # Must end with: /worktree/synth-{task_id}
   
   # Verify correct branch
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "synth-{task_id}" ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: Wrong branch. Expected synth-{task_id}, got $CURRENT_BRANCH"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   # Verify .claude instructions are present
   if [ ! -f .claude/commands/task-coordinator.md ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: .claude instructions not found. Worktree not created from main branch."
     exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "✅ Worktree structure validated successfully"
   ```
   
   **If validation fails, STOP immediately and report BLOCKED status.**

4. Must read `.claude/platform_enforcement.md` and transform the task to use the platform and language declared in that file.
   instead of the platform+language declared in the task description.

5. If its a multi-cloud task, notify the user and stop every execution. This project is only for AWS tasks.

6. **Working Directory Context**:
   - You are now in: `worktree/synth-{task_id}/`
   - All file paths are relative to this directory
   - All sub-agents will work in this directory
   - Do not return to main repo until Phase 5 (PR creation)
7. **Generate metadata.json with ALL required fields** (CRITICAL - validation will fail if any field is missing):
    - If `metadata.json` is not present, extract platform and language from the selected task
    - Validate `cli/create-task.ts` exists before mimicking its actions
    - If `cli/create-task.ts` is missing, use fallback platform detection logic:
    - Determine platform (cdk, cdktf, cfn, tf, pulumi) from task description
    - Determine language (ts, py, yaml, json, hcl) from task description
    - Prefer TypeScript for tests only, avoid Python where possible (unless the project is in python e.g. pulumi-py, cdktf-py)
    - Set `complexity` (NOT "difficulty") from CSV difficulty field
    - Set `team` as "synth" (REQUIRED - validation will fail without this)
    - Set `startedAt` as current timestamp using `date -Iseconds` (REQUIRED - validation will fail without this)
    - **Extract `subtask` and `subject_labels` from tasks.csv** (REQUIRED - validation will fail without these):
      - Read the selected task row from tasks.csv
      - Get the `subtask` value from the subtask column
      - Get the `subject_labels` value from the subject_labels column (parse as JSON array)
      - Both fields MUST be included in metadata.json
    - Do not add more fields to metadata.json than the ones shown in the example below
    - Validate `templates/` directory exists and contains required platform template
    - If template missing, report BLOCKED status with specific template needed
    - Copy appropriate template from `templates/` directory
    - Generate `metadata.json` with ALL required fields. Set `po_id` field to the task_id value. Example:

   ```json
    {
       "platform": "cdk",
       "language": "ts",
       "complexity": "hard",
       "turn_type": "single",
       "po_id": "trainr97",
       "team": "synth",
       "startedAt": "2025-08-12T13:19:10-05:00",
       "subtask": "Application Deployment",
       "subject_labels": ["CI/CD Pipeline", "Security Configuration as Code"]
     }
   ```

    - **Validate metadata.json immediately after creation**:
      - Run: `bash scripts/detect-metadata.sh` to verify all required fields are present
      - If validation fails, fix the metadata.json before proceeding
      - Common errors: missing `team`, missing `startedAt`, missing `subtask`, missing `subject_labels`, using `difficulty` instead of `complexity`
    - If the deployment needs to be done in a specific region, create the file `lib/AWS_REGION` with the
      region name. e.g: `echo "us-east-1" > lib/AWS_REGION`
8. Install dependencies inside the worktree with error handling:
    - If language is py: `pipenv install --dev --ignore-pipfile`
    - If language is not py: `npm ci`
    - If installation fails, report BLOCKED status with error details
9. Use the selected task description for the workflow. Start the workflow.
    - Report final status before handoff to next agent

Important: Do not generate the `/lib/PROMPT.md` code, delegate that to the subagent. Send the task information to the generator agent


## Task Completion Requirements
Important: If, for any reason, you're unable to finish the task. set the task status in the csv as "error" and put the error
information inside the trainr_notes column of that task.

Additional:
- If you find an issue in the task description that blocks you from deploying the infrastructure properly, and its an issue
  that can block future tasks, document it in `.claude/lessons_learnt.md`

## Status Reporting Requirements
You must always report in each log, the taskId you're working on and the region specified for deployment (default is us-east-1).

All subagents MUST report their execution status to the coordinator using the following format:

### Status Format

```markdown
**AGENT STATUS**: [PHASE] - [STATUS] - [CURRENT_STEP]
**TASK**: [Specific task being worked on]
**PROGRESS**: [X/Y] steps completed
**NEXT ACTION**: [Description of next planned action]
**ISSUES**: [Any blocking issues or errors encountered - NONE if no issues]
**BLOCKED**: [YES/NO - If YES, explain blocking reason and required resolution]
```

### Required Status Updates

Each sub-agent must provide status updates at these key points:

- **Start of execution**: Report phase initiation with task description
- **Step completion**: Report after each major workflow step with current task
- **Error encounters**: Immediate status report when errors occur with blocking status
- **Blocking situations**: Report when unable to proceed and what's needed to continue
- **Phase completion**: Final status with outcomes and handoff details

### Agent-Specific Reporting
Please refer to the specific agent's documentation for reporting requirements.

## Usage

When presented with an IaC task:

1. **Task Selection**: Use `iac-task-selector` to choose the task
2. **Generate**: Use `iac-infra-generator` to create initial implementation
3. **Validate**: Use `iac-infra-qa-trainer` to test and perfect the solution
4. **Review**: Use `iac-code-reviewer` to ensure production readiness

### Coordination Protocol

The coordinator will:

- Monitor all sub-agent status reports for task progress and blocking issues
- Intervene immediately when agents report BLOCKED: YES status
- Facilitate resolution of blocking issues by providing additional context or resources
- Ensure proper handoff between phases with complete task and issue status
- Maintain overall workflow visibility with real-time status tracking
- Escalate to user when multiple agents report blocking issues that require external resolution

### Issue Resolution Process

When sub-agents report issues or blocking conditions:

1. **Non-blocking issues**: Coordinator logs the issue and monitors for escalation
2. **Blocking issues**: Coordinator immediately:
   - Analyzes the blocking condition reported by the sub-agent
   - Attempts automated resolution (file access, dependency installation, etc.)
   - If unable to resolve, provides specific guidance to the sub-agent
   - Escalates to user with detailed issue description if automated resolution fails

This coordinated approach ensures robust, tested, and compliant infrastructure code with full execution
transparency and proactive issue resolution.
