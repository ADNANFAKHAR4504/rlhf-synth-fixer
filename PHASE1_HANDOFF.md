- **Language**: HCL
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Subject**: Cloud Environment Setup

## Task Description
Set up a cloud environment on AWS using Terraform with the following key requirements:
- Create VPC with public and private subnets in us-west-2
- Deploy EC2 instances (t3.medium) and RDS PostgreSQL database

2. ✅ Created branch: `synth-trainr932`
3. ✅ Platform validated: Terraform HCL (AWS-only task)
4. ✅ Created metadata.json with all required fields
5. ✅ Created lib/AWS_REGION file with: `us-west-2`
6. ✅ Initialized Terraform with AWS provider v6.9.0
7. ✅ Template files copied from tf-hcl template

## Status for Next Phase
- **CSV Status**: Updated to `in_progress`
- **Git Status**: Clean worktree on branch `synth-trainr932`
- **Ready for**: Phase 2 - Generator Agent to create lib/PROMPT.md

## Notes
- Platform enforcement file indicated cfn+yaml preference, but task trainr932 was already selected as Terraform HCL before the change
- This is an AWS-only task (no multi-cloud requirements)
- All dependencies installed successfully (Terraform AWS provider v6.9.0)
