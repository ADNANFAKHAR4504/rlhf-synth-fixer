The deployment is failing because of an **incomplete alb module**, as well as missing ec2 module
Also the root main.tf configuration as well as root variables is missing 

Identify gaps in the your current configuration, and recommend steps on how to restructure the Terraform code to:  
1. Complete the alb, and ec2 module.  
2. Complete the root level configuration with all module imports and variable or/and locals configuration
The expected output should include:  
- A clear evaluation and resolution of the failure


If the response exceeds the output limit, continue seamlessly across multiple outputs until the entire task is fully completed.
Do not limit the response by character or token count. Continue generating until the entire task is fully completed, using as many turns as necessary. Resume exactly from where the previous output ended without repeating or omitting any content, and only stop once the task is finished.
