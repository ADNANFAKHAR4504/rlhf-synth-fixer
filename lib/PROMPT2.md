I'm having issues with the code you provided. The tap-stack.ts file appears to be incomplete - it cuts off in the middle. Could you please provide the complete file?

Also, I'm getting TypeScript errors in the modules.ts file. It seems like the import names are wrong. For example, it's complaining that `DataAwsCallerIdentity` doesn't exist, but suggests `dataAwsCallerIdentity` instead. Can you fix all the import names to match what's actually available in the @cdktf/provider-aws package?
