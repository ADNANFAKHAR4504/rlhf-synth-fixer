We are working on setting up AWS infrastructure using CDK for Terraform and running into some issues with the imports and configuration.
we need to build a complete infrastructure stack but I'm having trouble with the provider imports.
we need to use dataAwsCallerIdentity instead of DataAwsCallerIdentity.
