❌ Model Failure Report: TapStack CDK Implementation
This report highlights gaps, deviations, and risks in your current implementation based on the ideal secure AWS infrastructure pattern for compliance-driven workloads.

🔒 Security & Compliance Failures
Area	Issue	Ideal	Current
S3 Access Logging	❌ Missing access logs for AppDataBucket	Enable logging via server_access_logs_bucket & server_access_logs_prefix	Not configured
SSH Access Scope	❌ SSH open to all private subnets (10.0.0.0/16)	Restrict to bastion host subnet (10.0.1.0/24)	CIDR too wide
CloudTrail Monitoring	❌ Missing CloudTrail for IAM role activity	CloudTrail should be configured for IAM and console events	Not implemented
VPC Flow Logs Role	❌ Deprecated managed policy used (VPCFlowLogsDeliveryRolePolicy)	Replace with inline policy allowing required CloudWatch Logs actions	Fixed (you’ve addressed this)
Launch Template	⚠️ Created but unused	Should either be removed or used via ASG	Defined but not referenced in EC2 instantiation

⚠️ Infrastructure-as-Code Gaps
Area	Issue	Ideal	Current
Consistency	🔶 launch_template is defined but EC2 instance is created separately	Reuse launch template for EC2 instance or future ASG	Not wired
S3 Logging Bucket Usage	🔶 Logging bucket exists but is not used for access logs	app_data_bucket should log to logs_bucket	Missing
Tagging Strategy	🔶 Resource tags are inconsistent	Apply uniform tags (Environment, Project, etc.) across all resources	Only Name and Backup tags applied selectively
Retention & Cleanup	🔶 Lifecycle and removal policies are fine, but RETAIN is preferred for prod-like environments	For compliance-sensitive environments, avoid DESTROY	Mostly using DESTROY

✅ What the Model Got Right
Feature	Status	Notes
KMS Key Configuration	✅	CMK with rotation and granular policy is correctly implemented
S3 Bucket Encryption	✅	KMS-based encryption and lifecycle rules defined
VPC Design	✅	Subnet configuration across 2 AZs with DNS support is accurate
IAM Least Privilege	✅	Inline policies for EC2 role scoped to specific resources
CloudWatch Integration	✅	Logs + metrics collected via CloudWatch agent and log groups
EC2 Instance Hardening	✅	Instance in private subnet, encrypted EBS, logs to CloudWatch

🧪 Testing & QA Gaps
Area	Issue	Ideal	Current
Unit Test Coverage	❌ Missing or partial	Should validate all resources: VPC, KMS, S3, IAM, SGs, CW	Not available
Integration Testing	❌ Missing	Should simulate synthesis, resource presence, and output	Not implemented
Template Validation	❌ Absent	Tests to verify naming, encryption, and subnet types	Missing

🔧 Recommended Improvements
Priority	Action
🔴 Critical	Enable access logging on S3 AppDataBucket via logs_bucket
🔴 Critical	Restrict SSH ingress to bastion subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
🟠 High	Use launch template for EC2 instance or document its reserved purpose
🟠 High	Add CloudTrail to monitor IAM activities
🟢 Optional	Add tagging consistency and apply RETAIN removal policy for prod use
🟢 Optional	Implement unit and integration test suites for validation

🚦 Final Verdict: Partially Production-Ready
Your current implementation is functional and secure in most areas, but misses several critical compliance and observability components expected in a secure enterprise-grade CDK deployment.
