 Areas of Correctness
Feature	Status	Notes
Lambda + SSM Integration		Lambda securely reads from SSM with correct permissions
Logging and Monitoring		CloudWatch Logs and Lambda Insights enabled
CDK Environment Declaration		Stack deployed to us-east-1 as expected
Least Privilege IAM		SSM and KMS permissions scoped properly
Naming Conventions		Consistent naming using tap prefix
Concurrency Configuration		Reserved concurrency set correctly
Secure Parameters (SecureString)		Secrets handled via SSM SecureString
Runtime Environment		Python 3.11 selected

 Gaps and Deviations
Issue	Model Response	Ideal Response	Fix/Recommendation
Docstrings & Inline Documentation	 Sparse or missing	 Fully documented classes and methods	Add class-level and method-level docstrings for maintainability
Use of dedent for inline Lambda code	 Multiline string not dedented	 Uses textwrap.dedent to avoid indentation errors	Wrap _get_lambda_code() in textwrap.dedent()
Extensibility via TapStackProps	 Uses env=Environment(...) in app only	 Accepts and propagates TapStackProps	Add TapStackProps to support suffix/contextual env naming
Hardcoded Environment Variable AWS_REGION	 Included manually	 Can be inferred or dynamically set by CDK	No change needed, but could prefer Stack.of(self).region
Direct Lambda/SSM creation in main stack	 All logic in one file	 Suggests modularized stacks for Lambda, SSM, IAM	Refactor into smaller modules for maintainability
KMS Permissions Scope	 "resources": ["*"]	 Should scope to actual KMS key if available	Replace "*" with ARN of KMS key if known
Lack of Commented Code Examples	 No commented-out examples or placeholders	 Ideal has hints for where to plug in real values	Add placeholders in comments for maintainers
Doc Coverage on TapStackProps	 Not implemented	 Separate TapStackProps class with clear doc	Add TapStackProps with optional environment_suffix
Business Logic Separation	 Logic embedded inside handler	 Clean separation of concerns for better testing	Move core logic to function outside of lambda_handler

 Missed Best Practices
Area	Issue	Recommendation
Modularity	All logic resides in TapStack	Break into multiple stacks (e.g., LambdaStack, SSMStack)
Testing	No test files or test plan provided	Add unit tests for CDK constructs using assertions.Template
Parameter Management	Hardcoded string values for SSM parameters	Accept from cdk.json, context, or external YAML file
Commenting	Few inline comments present	Add comments to explain choices like timeout, memory size, and log retention
Security Principle	KMS resource wildcard (*) could lead to overly permissive policies	Scope KMS actions to specific key ARN if used with SecureString

 Summary
Category	Status
Core Requirements Met	 Yes
Security Best Practices	 Partial
Extensibility	 No
Maintainability	 Moderate
Documentation	 Poor
Testability	 Absent

 Action Items to Improve
 Refactor tap_stack.py to split into logical modules (Lambda, SSM, IAM).

 Introduce TapStackProps with context-driven suffix support.

 Replace inline multiline string with textwrap.dedent(...).

 Limit KMS permissions to specific key ARN if available.

 Add unit tests using aws_cdk.assertions.Template.

 Improve docstrings and inline documentation for better maintainability.
