# Model Failures

- **High availability architecture missing**  
  The response deploys a single Lambda and API Gateway without redundancy mechanisms failing the “high availability” requirement.

- **Auto-scaling claim unsubstantiated**  
  Lambda auto-scales automatically by default, but no cAPI Gateway throttling/usage plan was set. The solution does not explicitly demonstrate or test scaling behavior.

- **Logging to S3 not implemented**  
  Prompt requires that all logs generated by Lambda and the application be stored in a versioned S3 bucket. The response creates CloudWatch Logs but no S3 bucket or log export configuration.

- **Versioning not enabled on any S3 bucket**  
  The prompt explicitly demands versioned S3 buckets for logs, no bucket versioning configuration is included.

- **CloudWatch monitoring incomplete**  
  Only default logging is implied. No custom CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, or alarms for invocation.

- **Region provider not enforced**  
  The code does not instantiate an aws.Provider(region="us-east-1") or set Pulumi configuration for the region, so deployment may target the default account region incorrectly.

- **No documentation or inline comments explaining resources**  
  Minimal or no comments accompany the Pulumi code, violating the “well-documented for maintainability” requirement.

- **S3 bucket for logs unused by Lambda**  
  Even if a bucket is defined, the Lambda does not reference it for log delivery or export; logs only go to CloudWatch.

- **Operational metrics absent**  
  No setup for error/alarm thresholds or cloudwatch.MetricAlarm definitions — metrics are not actively monitored.

- **Security best practices incomplete**  
  No encryption specified for S3, no explicit deny public access policy, and no KMS integration for data at rest or in transit.

- **Code readability and structure**  
  Variables are inlined with resource definitions, little to no abstraction or parameterization, which limits maintainability and reusability.
