The error indicates that your CloudFormation stack is in ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state, which means a previous deployment failed and rolled back. You need to delete the existing stack first before deploying again. However, I also notice the Lambda function code was truncated in my previous response, which likely caused the deployment failure.
