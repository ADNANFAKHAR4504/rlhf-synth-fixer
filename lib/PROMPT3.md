I'm having a frustrating time with TypeScript compilation errors in my CDKTF project. Every time I try to import AWS resources, I get these naming mismatches.
The main problem I'm facing is that the class names seem to have changed in newer versions of the provider. I keep trying to use S3BucketServerSideEncryptionConfiguration but apparently it should be S3BucketServerSideEncryptionConfigurationA now? Same issue with S3BucketVersioning vs S3BucketVersioningA.
I'm also confused about the CloudTrail imports - sometimes it works with cloudtrail and sometimes it doesn't.
