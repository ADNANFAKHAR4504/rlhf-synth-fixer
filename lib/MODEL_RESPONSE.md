# Model Response (Failed Implementation)

**Status**: Failed - Empty Response

**Issue**: The model failed to generate any meaningful response to the consolidation prompt. Instead of implementing the required 14 functional requirements for Lambda consolidation with cost optimization, the model produced only placeholder text.

**Expected**: Complete CDK TypeScript implementation with:
- Single consolidated Lambda function
- ARM64 Graviton2 architecture
- DynamoDB on-demand billing
- HTTP API Gateway with backward-compatible routes
- CloudWatch monitoring and automated rollback
- S3 lifecycle management
- Cost allocation tags
- Security best practices

**Actual**: Empty placeholder content with no implementation.

**Impact**: Complete failure to deliver functional infrastructure code, resulting in inability to deploy or achieve cost optimization targets.

This represents a critical model failure where complex, multi-requirement prompts were not properly processed or understood. The MODEL_FAILURES.md file contains detailed analysis of what should have been implemented based on the IDEAL_RESPONSE.md solution.
