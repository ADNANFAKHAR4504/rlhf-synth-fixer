Generate a production-ready code to deploy a secure, highly available Amazon EKS cluster in us-east-1 across three Availability Zones. The configuration must include a VPC with private subnets for nodes, public subnets for load balancers, and NAT gateways; an EKS cluster with private API access; three managed node groups (t3.medium, t3.large, t3.xlarge) with autoscaling; IRSA roles for cluster autoscaler and EBS CSI driver (gp3 default); dedicated IAM roles for backend, frontend, and data-processing workloads; network policies to restrict inter-namespace traffic; CloudWatch logging; aws-auth ConfigMap for IAM access; and tagging for Environment, ManagedBy, and CostCenter. Output the cluster endpoint, and aws eks update-kubeconfig command. The code must be modular, parameterized, follow AWS best practices, and successfully pass cdktf synth, cdktf diff, and cdktf deploy without errors.
