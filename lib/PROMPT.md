Serverless Notification System using AWS CloudFormation with YAML in a single file

A retail app needs to handle 2,000 daily order update notifications efficiently. The system must be fully serverless, reliable, and include basic monitoring for visibility.

Create a notification system using CloudFormation with:

    •	SNS for publishing and managing notifications
    •	Lambda (Node.js) for message processing
    •	DynamoDB for logging notification events
    •	CloudWatch for performance metrics and monitoring
    •	SES for email fallback when push delivery fails
    •	IAM for secure access and role-based permissions
