# CI/CD Pipeline

Create a Pulumi TypeScript program to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline for containerized applications. The configuration must: 1. Create an S3 bucket for pipeline artifacts with versioning enabled and lifecycle rules to delete objects older than 30 days. 2. Set up an ECR repository with image scanning on push enabled and a lifecycle policy to retain only the last 10 images. 3. Configure a CodeBuild project that builds Docker images from a GitHub repository using a buildspec.yml file. 4. Create a CodePipeline with three stages: Source (GitHub), Build (CodeBuild), and Deploy (manual approval). 5. Set up IAM roles and policies for CodePipeline and CodeBuild with least-privilege access. 6. Configure the pipeline to trigger on GitHub webhook events for the main branch. 7. Add SNS topic for pipeline state change notifications. 8. Tag all resources with Environment=production and ManagedBy=pulumi.
