Help write an AWS CDK application in Python that deploys EC2 monitoring for a SaaS startup running 15 EC2 t3.medium instances in a VPC (10.0.0.0/16). The solution should include Security Groups allowing HTTP traffic on port 80, CloudWatch alarms for memory usage above 80%, and basic performance monitoring. Logs from the instances should be sent to both S3 and CloudWatch Logs. IAM roles and policies should be configured to allow secure monitoring access. The design must remain simple, cost-effective, and deploy successfully without errors.
