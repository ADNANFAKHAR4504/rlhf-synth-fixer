Create a single Terraform configuration file named tap_stack.tf containing all variables, locals, resources, and outputs (no provider block, no module references) that fulfills the following security and infrastructure requirements:
1. There is requirement to have resources deployed in three different regions us-east-1 and us-west-2 and eu-central-1. So Please create proper VPC in each region and set specific CIDR for the VPC. VPCs with CIDR blocks: 10.0.0.0/16 for the primary and 10.1.0.0/16 for the secondary region and 10.1.0.0/16 for the third region
2. VPCs should have 2 private and 2 public subnets in each VPC for each region. Also  crate necessary Nat gateway, internet gateway, route table and route t
able association as per the network infrastructure requirements. Implement high availability with at least three availability zones, automatic failover, and robust redundancy plans. Use NAT Gateways to allow internet access for resources in private subnets. 
3. Deploy EC2 instance behind auto scaling in multi availably zone  using amazon linux2 latest AMI for each regions respectively.
4. Implement Application Load Balancers to manage traffic with health checks in respective regions. 
5.  Implement Individual RDS in each region but with multiple AZ support for respective regions in their respective regions. Use random master user name of length 8 without special characters and it should start with alphabet. and master random password of length 16 with special characters. Make sure not to use any special characters which aws doesn't allow for RDS. Also snapshot or deletion protection is not needed for RDS. Use AWS secrete manager to store these username and password in each regions respectively. Ensure that all RDS instances are set to not be publicly accessible. Configure RDS instances for automatic minor version upgrades to maintain database efficiency and security. Configure Multi-AZ deployments for RDS instances to ensure high availability. Encrypt data at rest in the RDS instance.
6. Integrate S3 buckets with versioning and server-side encryption for logs.
7. Define IAM roles and use CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
8. Tag all resources with 'Environment: Production
