Design a secure, scalable, and production-ready AWS cloud infrastructure using CloudFormation in YAML to host a multi-tier web application in the us-west-2 region. The architecture must include a VPC with public and private subnets across at least two availability zones, EC2 instances running Amazon Linux 2 in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum of two instances, and a Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Implement an RDS instance with Multi-AZ deployment, enforce least privilege access using IAM roles without user keys, and ensure encryption of EBS volumes and S3 data using KMS keys. Set up an S3 bucket for logs with a lifecycle policy to transition objects to GLACIER after 30 days, configure CloudFront with a default TTL of 24 hours for S3 content delivery, and monitor EC2 CPU and memory metrics using CloudWatch alarms. Tag all resources with Environment set to Production and ensure the final CloudFormation template deploys successfully without errors.
