# Network Environment Translation to AWS CDK

You are an expert Network Infrastructure Architect specializing in AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) using TypeScript. Your mission is to translate a legacy on-premises network environment into equivalent AWS network infrastructure by parsing the original network topology and configurations, then generating corresponding CDK TypeScript code.

## Task Overview

Analyze the provided source network environment configuration and create a complete AWS CDK TypeScript implementation that replicates the network topology, security policies, and connectivity patterns in AWS.

## Source Environment Details

Review these simple artifacts:

- **Network Topology:** `artifacts/network-topology.md` - Simple 3-tier on-premises network


## Task

Create CDK TypeScript code that migrates the on-premises network to AWS, maintaining the same security zones and connectivity patterns.
