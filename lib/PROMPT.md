AWS Multi-Region Web Application Deployment - (Pulumi TypeScript)
==============================================================================

**Environment**
---------------

*   Deploy web application in multi-region AWS environment using **Pulumi with TypeScript**
    
*   Must utilize AWS GovCloud for maximum security
    
*   Comply with US Government regulations
    
*   Support auto-scaling features for application instances
    

**Project Details**
-------------------
    
*   **Difficulty Level:** Expert
    
*   **Technology Stack:** Pulumi + TypeScript
    

**Requirements**
----------------

*   Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment
    
*   Incorporate AWS GovCloud regions for enhanced security and compliance
    
*   Design infrastructure for automatic scaling based on CPU utilization metrics
    
*   Include comprehensive resource tagging for all AWS resources
    
*   Deliver **Pulumi TypeScript configuration** instead of Terraform HCL
    
*   Ensure deployment passes pulumi preview and pulumi up
    
*   Verify instance scaling functionality is operational
    

**Constraints**
---------------

*   Must be compatible with AWS GovCloud
    
*   Implement automated scaling based on CPU utilization thresholds
    
*   Maintain high compliance and security standards
    
*   Support variable load management through efficient resource scaling
    
*   Use Python as the programming language for infrastructure definition
    

**Expected Deliverables**
