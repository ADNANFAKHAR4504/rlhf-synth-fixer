We need to set up a simple but reliable AWS environment for a blog platform that serves around 5,000 daily readers. The goal is to balance uptime, basic monitoring, and secure delivery with a low-cost footprint. Use AWS CDK in TypeScript to define the infrastructure. The design should create a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 and deploy t3.micro EC2 instances running Apache in public subnets. Security groups should allow inbound HTTP traffic on port 80 only. Static content must be stored in an S3 bucket without public access, and EC2 monitoring should be enabled with CloudWatch to track CPU usage and status checks. IAM roles should follow least privilege principles, giving EC2 just enough access to read from S3 and write logs. The solution should produce three CDK files—bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json—and only the code should be returned, without extra explanations or comments. Everything should be deployed to the us-east-1 region, with consistent naming based on <Service>-BlogApp-us-east-1.
Output should be the full TypeScript CDK code files required for deployment, with no explanation, no comments, and nothing extra—only the code.
