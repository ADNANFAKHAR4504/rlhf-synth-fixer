Generate a production-ready code to deploy an application in TypeScript to provision a secure and highly available AWS infrastructure for a mission-critical application for reusable infrastructure and security modules, where the architecture must include a 2-AZ VPC, private EC2 instances behind a public Application Load Balancer (ALB), comprehensive security features like Security Hub, WAF, KMS/SSE-S3 encryption, IAM MFA, and CloudTrail/SNS for policy alerts, a non-public RDS instance, detailed CloudWatch monitoring, high-availability features such as Auto Recovery, and utilize a remote Terraform backend (S3/DynamoDB), all while adhering to DevSecOps principles and exposing critical resource IDs via CDKTF outputs.
