Create a single CloudFormation template that orchestrates a comprehensive, production ready cloud infrastructure designed to host a modern web application with high availability requirements. Your template should establish a resilient network foundation by configuring a Virtual Private Cloud that strategically spans across two availability zones, ensuring fault tolerance and optimal performance distribution. Within this VPC architecture, you'll need to implement a sophisticated subnet strategy that segregates resources between public facing and private components, specifically provisioning four subnets where two serve as public gateways and two maintain private isolation for sensitive backend services.

The template should seamlessly integrate compute resources by deploying EC2 instances within the public subnets, configured with security groups that allow HTTP traffic on port 80 and SSH access on port 22 restricted to administrator IP addresses. To ensure private subnet resources maintain internet connectivity for essential updates and external API calls, incorporate a NAT Gateway that serves as the controlled egress point while preserving the isolation of backend systems.

For data persistence and reliability, your solution must provision an Amazon RDS instance that leverages Multi AZ deployment capabilities to guarantee database availability even during zone failures, positioning these database resources exclusively within the private subnets to maintain network isolation. The RDS configuration should explicitly prohibit public internet access while establishing connectivity channels exclusively for your EC2 instances through appropriate security group configurations.

Operational excellence demands comprehensive monitoring capabilities, so integrate CloudWatch across all provisioned instances to capture critical metrics and establish visibility into system health and performance patterns. The infrastructure should also incorporate an S3 bucket dedicated to storing CloudFormation templates and related artifacts, configured with access controls to prevent unauthorized public access while maintaining operational accessibility.

To enable role based access patterns, establish an IAM role specifically tailored for EC2 instances that grants read only permissions to the S3 bucket, following the principle of least privilege while enabling necessary operational workflows. The entire infrastructure definition should be captured in a well structured single YAML file that adheres to CloudFormation best practices, including proper use of parameters for flexibility, outputs for resource discovery, and logical organization that enhances maintainability and reusability across different deployment scenarios.
