```
Please generate IAC code is CloudFormation Yaml using the data given below:

Contraints:

Ensure IAM roles restrict access to only necessary AWS services and resources. | All resources must comply with CIS AWS Foundations security benchmarks. | Implement encryption for all data at rest and in transit.

Environment:

Design a robust security configuration for an AWS environment using CloudFormation. The template must satisfy the following requirements: 1. Define IAM roles and policies that restrict access to only necessary AWS services and resources. 2. Implement security controls compliant with CIS AWS Foundations benchmarks. 3. Ensure all data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Expected output: a CloudFormation YAML template that successfully deploys in AWS, passing compliance checks and all associated unit tests.

Proposed Statement:

The infrastructure must be deployed in the AWS us-east-1 region. Use existing VPC configurations and ensure naming conventions start with 'corp-'. Implement security best practices aligned with company policy.
