Environment Migration,Provisioning of Infrastructure Environments,"Translate existing on-prem or other-cloud networks and security into AWS equivalents using IaC (CDK/Terraform/CloudFormation). Focus on CIDR/subnet mapping, route tables, security group parity, and connectivity validation (VPN/TGW as needed)."
Cloud Environment Setup,Provisioning of Infrastructure Environments,"Stand up a greenfield, best-practice AWS foundation (VPC, subnets, IGW/NAT, ALB/ASG, tags/outputs). Validate reachability, health checks, and baseline security for rapid app onboarding."
Multi-Environment Consistency,IaC-Multi-Environment-Management,"Reuse one module/template to deploy identical topologies across dev/stage/prod with parameter differences only. Prove parity by diffing plans/stacks and enforcing environment-specific tags/limits."
Web Application Deployment,Provisioning of Infrastructure Environments,"Provision full three-tier stacks (ALB → compute → RDS) with bootstrap/user-data and secure security group chaining. Verify end-to-end traffic flow and private-only database access with encryption at rest."
Serverless Infrastructure (Functions as Code),Application Deployment,"Model APIs and event flows with API Gateway/Lambda/DynamoDB/S3/EventBridge using IaC. Test function invocations, data persistence, DLQs/alarms, and least-privilege IAM."
CI/CD Pipeline,CI/CD Pipeline,"Design and implement multi-account, multi-stage CI/CD pipelines with secure OIDC authentication. Focus on automated build/test/deploy workflows with security scanning (cdk-nag), manual approval gates, cross-account role assumptions, KMS-encrypted artifacts, and CloudFormation change sets for safe deployments."
Failure Recovery Automation,Failure Recovery and High Availability,"Deploy mirrored stacks across regions/accounts with Route53 failover and data replication (S3/RDS). Validate health checks and controlled switchover without changing application semantics."
Security Configuration as Code,"Security, Compliance and Governance","Encode IAM, security groups, encryption, Config rules, and boundaries as auditable templates/modules. Enforce least-privilege and compliance via static analysis (cfn-nag/tfsec/checkov) and runtime checks."
IaC Diagnosis/Edits,IaC Program Optimization,"Fix broken stacks/modules: permissions, dependencies, state imports, and template modularization. Preserve live resources, add tests/linting, and justify any necessary suppressions or refactors."
IaC Optimization,IaC Program Optimization,"Reduce cost/latency and strengthen security without changing topology (Spot/MixedInstances, gp3, WAF/TLS). Improve reusability and build speed (modules, caching, CDK/TF tuning) while maintaining infra parity."
Infrastructure Analysis/Monitoring,IaC Program Optimization,"Use Boto3/CLI scripts to inventory, detect waste/misconfig (unused EBS, open security groups, NAT/EIP, log sizes). Emit JSON/CSV reports and wire to CI to continuously flag cost/security issues."
General Infrastructure Tooling QA,Infrastructure QA and Management,"Explain and correct IaC/CLI usage with annotated examples, safe snippets, and step-by-step procedures. Review snippets for risks, propose fixes, and document validation commands/output."
