# Disaster Recovery Prompt Reference

This repository includes two prompt documents. The authoritative, human-authored brief is located at `lib/PROMPT.md`. It provides the conversational context, business drivers, and detailed requirements we use to build and validate the infrastructure.

To avoid duplication and keep a single source of truth:

- **Use `lib/PROMPT.md` as the primary reference** for implementation details and reviews.
- This file is retained only as a pointer for legacy tooling. It intentionally mirrors the high-level project title so existing links continue to work.

➡️ **Next step:** open [`lib/PROMPT.md`](lib/PROMPT.md) for the full brief.
