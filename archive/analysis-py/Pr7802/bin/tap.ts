/**
 * Pulumi application entry point for the TAP (Test Automation Platform) infrastructure.
 *
 * This module defines the core Pulumi stack and instantiates the TapStack with appropriate
 * configuration based on the deployment environment. It handles environment-specific settings,
 * tagging, and deployment configuration for AWS resources.
 *
 * The stack created by this module uses environment suffixes to distinguish between
 * different deployment environments (development, staging, production, etc.).

// Import the infrastructure stack - this will execute the stack instantiation
