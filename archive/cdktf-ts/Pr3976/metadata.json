  "training_quality_justification": "High-quality training data with comprehensive infrastructure requirements and detailed failure analysis. The PROMPT provides production-grade AWS architecture requirements using CDKTF. MODEL_FAILURES.md documents 14 distinct technical failures with excellent depth, covering critical areas: (1) CDKTF token resolution issues with availability zones, (2) S3 bucket naming anti-patterns breaking Terraform state, (3) RDS password security vulnerabilities, (4) AWS provider version compatibility (S3 resource types), (5) S3 ACL configuration post-2023 AWS changes, (6) Multi-region ELB service account handling, (7) CloudFront certificate region requirements, (8) Resource dependency timing issues. The IDEAL_RESPONSE demonstrates correct patterns with explicit AZ configuration, deterministic naming, AWS Secrets Manager integration, proper resource ordering, and comprehensive security controls. This provides substantial retraining value for learning CDKTF-specific patterns, AWS service integration nuances, security best practices, and infrastructure-as-code principles. Minor deductions: some issues are provider version-specific rather than fundamental architectural patterns, and MODEL_RESPONSE comparison is limited.",
