Generate a production-ready AWS CDKTF program that deploys an Amazon EKS cluster in the us-east-1 region across three Availability Zones. The setup must include a custom VPC with public subnets for load balancers, three private subnets for worker nodes, and NAT Gateways for outbound access. Create two managed node groups—one for system workloads (2× t3.medium) and one for application workloads (min 3, max 10× m5.large, supporting both spot and on-demand instances). Enable OIDC provider, IRSA roles, cluster autoscaler, AWS Load Balancer Controller, and EKS add-ons for CoreDNS and kube-proxy. Implement EKS control plane logging (api, controllerManager, scheduler), enforce pod security standards (baseline), and create an ECR repository for container images. Tag all resources with Environment=Production and ManagedBy=CDK, and output the cluster name, OIDC provider URL, kubectl configuration command, and ECR repository URI.
