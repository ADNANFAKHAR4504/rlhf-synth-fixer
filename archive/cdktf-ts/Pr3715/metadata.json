  "training_quality": 8.5,
  "training_quality_justification": "Excellent multi-region disaster recovery implementation with comprehensive CDKTF patterns. High training value due to: (1) Complex AWS architecture spanning 15+ services with proper cross-region configuration, (2) Production-ready security features including per-region KMS encryption, IAM least privilege, and TLS enforcement, (3) Complete disaster recovery workflow with automated failover (RTO < 5 minutes), (4) Comprehensive test coverage with 74 unit tests and 21 integration tests achieving 100% coverage, (5) Well-documented comparison between MODEL_RESPONSE failures and IDEAL_RESPONSE corrections, demonstrating critical CDKTF patterns and AWS best practices. Minor deduction for complexity that may challenge model learning capacity.",
