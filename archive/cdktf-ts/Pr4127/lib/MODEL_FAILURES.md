## Model Response Failures

### 1. Critical Security Vulnerabilities

The most significant failures in the model's response are related to its handling of sensitive database credentials.

- Use of Hardcoded Passwords: The model uses a `TerraformVariable` with a hardcoded default password (`WordPr3ss!2024`). The ideal response avoids this anti-pattern entirely by using the `random` provider to generate a cryptographically secure, random password at deployment time.
- Omission of Secrets Manager: The ideal response demonstrates a crucial security best practice by storing the generated database password in AWS Secrets Manager. The model's response omits this service, opting to manage the password insecurely.
- Plaintext Credentials in User Data: The model embeds the database password directly and in plaintext into the EC2 `userData` script. This is a critical security flaw, as user data is easily accessible in the AWS console. The ideal response correctly implements a secure pattern where the EC2 instance is granted IAM permissions to fetch the secret at runtime, ensuring the password is never exposed in the code or configuration.

### 2. Architectural and Configuration Deviations

The model's architecture and configuration choices differ significantly from the specified ideal.

- Lack of High Availability: The ideal response creates a multi-AZ architecture by deploying two subnets in `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b` to ensure high availability for the application. The model fails to replicate this, deploying its web server into a single availability zone (`us-west-2a`), which creates a single point of failure.
- Outdated Software Version: The model's `userData` script explicitly installs PHP 7.4. This is an outdated version. The ideal script installs a more recent version of PHP, which is better for performance and security.
- Incomplete WordPress Configuration: The `wp-config.php` file generated by the model's script leaves the crucial WordPress security salts and keys as placeholder values (`'put your unique phrase here'`). This leaves the final WordPress installation in an insecure, non-functional state. The ideal script creates a complete and secure configuration file.

### 3. Resource Naming and Implementation Style

- Static Resource Naming: The model uses static, hardcoded names for most resources (e.g., `wordpress-vpc`, `WebServerSG`). The ideal implementation correctly uses a random suffix (`Fn.substr(Fn.uuid(), 0, 8)`) for naming resources like security groups, IAM roles, and secrets. This is a best practice that prevents naming collisions and allows for multiple stacks to be deployed in the same account without conflict.
- Verbose Security Group Rules: The model defines security group rules using separate `SecurityGroupRule` resources. The ideal response uses a more concise and readable inline definition within the `SecurityGroup` resource itself.
