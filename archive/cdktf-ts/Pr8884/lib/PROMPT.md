Provision a secure and scalable infrastructure using Terraform in the AWS us-east-1 region. Create a VPC with at least two public subnets and two private subnets for network segregation. Attach an Internet Gateway that connects to the public subnets to enable internet access for resources deployed there. Deploy a NAT Gateway in a public subnet that routes outbound traffic from private subnets to the internet while keeping private resources inaccessible from the internet. Set up VPC Flow Logs that send network traffic data to a CloudWatch log group for monitoring and analysis, with an IAM role attached to the VPC that grants permissions to write logs to CloudWatch. Configure route tables that associate public subnets with the Internet Gateway and private subnets with the NAT Gateway for proper traffic routing. Ensure all resources are tagged with 'Environment: Production'. Write the infrastructure in declarative HCL, ensuring syntax correctness and automated deployment using Terraform.
