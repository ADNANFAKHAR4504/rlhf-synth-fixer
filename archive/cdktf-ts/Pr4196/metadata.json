  "training_quality_justification": "Excellent training value (9/10). Fixed 10 critical deployment failures involving complex multi-service integration. Identified significant model knowledge gaps in AWS resource naming conventions, Terraform property naming (snake_case vs camelCase), IAM/KMS policy completeness for CloudTrail, tag management, and CDKTF v0.20+ import structure. All PROMPT requirements correctly implemented. High-value training data demonstrating real-world deployment blockers and their resolutions.",
