Build a **serverless ETL pipeline** in **AWS CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) using TypeScript**, organized into two files — `modules.ts` for reusable constructs and `tap-stack.ts` for stack composition. The pipeline automatically processes CSV files uploaded to an **S3 bucket**, triggering a **validation Lambda** that checks file structure and sends valid data to a **Step Functions** workflow. The workflow orchestrates **validation**, **transformation**, and **notification** steps using **Lambdas**, stores metadata in **DynamoDB**, and sends alerts via **SNS** on failure. All components — **S3, Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, and SNS** — follow best practices for **encryption, IAM least privilege, X-Ray tracing, CloudWatch monitoring**, and **automated recovery**, ensuring a secure, fault-tolerant, and fully serverless ETL system.
