  "training_quality_justification": "The model initially generated functional CDKTF code but required several fixes: (1) TypeScript compilation errors with incorrect stack inheritance and property names, (2) Missing environment suffix for resource isolation, (3) Incorrect ElastiCache configuration structure, (4) Missing RDS read replica due to compatibility issues. The model demonstrated good understanding of AWS architecture patterns but needed refinement in CDKTF-specific syntax and multi-environment deployment practices. The training value is moderate as the fixes provide useful examples of common CDKTF pitfalls.",
