Create a production-ready AWS infrastructure using CDKTF in TypeScript for an e-commerce application. Build a modular, multi-environment system that provisions a VPC with public/private subnets across multiple availability zones, NAT and Internet Gateways, security groups for ALB/application/database tiers, an RDS PostgreSQL instance with automated secret management, an Application Load Balancer with optional HTTPS support, and an EC2 Auto Scaling Group using Amazon Linux 2023. Include IAM roles for Secrets Manager and CloudWatch access, SSH key pair management with secure private key storage, S3 backend for state management with locking, and comprehensive tagging. The infrastructure should support environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/production) with conditional logic for instance sizes, backup retention, deletion protection, and scaling parameters. Follow AWS best practices for security, high availability, and implement proper resource dependencies throughout the stack.
