Design a self-contained, production-ready CDKTF configuration in TypeScript for AWS that deploys a secure and scalable cloud environment suitable for production workloads, resulting in two files: modules.ts (containing reusable infrastructure logic) and taps-stack.ts (defining the main stack). The configuration must meet the following requirements: deploy all resources to the us-east-1 region; use a CDKTF TfVariable to allow users to specify the EC2 instance type for a key compute resource; implement IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege for all resources; use AWS Secrets Manager to securely create and manage a dummy sensitive value such as a database password; configure a VPC with at least one public and one private subnet, including an Internet Gateway and a NAT Gateway to enable internet access; and apply the tag Environment: Production to all resources. The output should include only the full content of the two files (modules.ts and taps-stack.ts), starting with a clear separator labeling the first file’s content.
