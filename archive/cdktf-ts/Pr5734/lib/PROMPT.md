Generate a production-ready Terraform configuration that deploys a highly available Amazon EKS cluster in the us-east-1 region using Terraform. The setup should include a VPC with private and public subnets, NAT Gateways for outbound internet access, and an Application Load Balancer for ingress. The EKS cluster must span three availability zones and use managed node groups supporting both x86_64 (t3.medium) and ARM64 (t4g.medium) instance types. Each node group should automatically scale between 2 and 10 nodes, and the configuration must include secure IAM roles, least-privilege policies, proper security groups, tagging, and outputs for kubeconfig to verify access.
