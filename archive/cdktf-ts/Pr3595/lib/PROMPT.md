Generate a production‑ready AWS CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) setup in TypeScript, targeting CloudFormation as the deployment backend. The infrastructure must support multi‑AZ high availability, follow a strict naming convention of Project‑Environment‑Resource (for example Tap‑Prod‑VPC), and be organized into exactly two files—lib/tap‑stack.ts (the main stack that composes and instantiates all modules) and lib/modules.ts (housing reusable constructs for VPC, EC2 autoscaled web in public subnets and backend in private, ELB, RDS in private, S3 for static assets, IAM roles and policies, CloudWatch + SNS alerts, Route 53 DNS, SSM Parameter Store). The infrastructure must be deployable via cdktf deploy targeting CloudFormation, secure (proper IAM, security groups), taggable (Project, Environment, Owner), allow zero‑downtime updates, follow CDKTF/IaC best practices, and be unit‑testable.
