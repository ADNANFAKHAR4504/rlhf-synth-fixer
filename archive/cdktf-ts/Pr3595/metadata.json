  "training_quality": 8,
  "training_quality_justification": "High-value training data with 4 critical fixes: (1) Fatal CDKTF syntax error (AZ interpolation using template literals instead of Fn.element), (2) Complete omission of VPC Flow Log resource despite correct dependencies, (3) Property casing errors (snake_case vs camelCase in TypeScript bindings), (4) Architectural security gap (missing RDS egress rules). The corrections demonstrate precise CDKTF-specific knowledge gaps and architectural security considerations. Domain complexity is high (production multi-tier AWS infrastructure with HA, monitoring, security). The MODEL_FAILURES.md provides excellent documentation of each failure with evidence. Strong improvement potential for CDKTF TypeScript syntax and AWS security best practices.",
