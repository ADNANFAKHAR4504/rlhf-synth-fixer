A news website serving around ten thousand readers daily across the globe needs a content delivery setup that minimizes latency, keeps costs under control, and is simple to maintain. Use AWS CDK with JavaScript to define the infrastructure. Articles should be stored in an S3 bucket, delivered through a CloudFront distribution configured with SSL, and managed via Route 53 for DNS. Apply an S3 bucket policy that supports controlled public access, track delivery and access metrics using CloudWatch, and secure stored content using KMS for encryption. The expected output is the complete CDK JavaScript code files that create this infrastructure. The response must include only the code with no explanations, no comments, and nothing extra.
