A healthcare application serving about five thousand users daily requires a secure and automated CI/CD pipeline that ensures compliance while supporting smooth deployments. The pipeline must include automated testing, security scans, compliance checks, and rollback capabilities for safe releases. Use AWS CDK with JavaScript to define the entire setup. The source should be managed with CodeCommit, builds and tests will be handled with CodeBuild, and CodePipeline should orchestrate the overall workflow. Deployments must use CodeDeploy with blue-green deployment strategies, while artifacts are stored in S3. CloudWatch should track and monitor pipeline activity, and a Lambda function must be included to perform security scans during the process. IAM roles should be carefully designed with least privilege to secure all stages of the pipeline. The expected output is the complete JavaScript CDK code for this infrastructure, with the response containing only the code and nothing else—no explanations or comments.
