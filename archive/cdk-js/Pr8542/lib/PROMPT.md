A fitness tracking platform needs a cost-efficient, scalable serverless API to handle about three thousand workout logs per day. The system should be built with AWS CDK using JavaScript and must prioritize security, performance, and operational visibility. Use API Gateway to expose REST endpoints, with AWS Lambda (Node.js 18) handling the log processing logic. Store workout data in DynamoDB configured with auto-scaling to handle varying workloads. IAM roles should follow the principle of least privilege for access control, and all configuration parameters should be managed securely through AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Include CloudWatch for metrics and monitoring to provide insights into API usage and system performance. The output should be the complete JavaScript CDK code implementing this infrastructure—only the code, with no explanations, descriptions, or comments.
