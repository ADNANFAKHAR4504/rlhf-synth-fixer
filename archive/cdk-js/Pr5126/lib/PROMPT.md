A fintech company needs an end-to-end ML serving stack that can handle roughly five hundred thousand fraud predictions per day, watch for model drift, and stay aligned with financial compliance requirements. Use AWS CDK with JavaScript (ES modules) to define everything and deploy via CloudFormation. Store versioned model artifacts in S3; stand up a SageMaker real-time endpoint (model, endpoint config, endpoint) for hosting; and place API Gateway in front as the managed HTTPS entry point. Include a Lambda function for request preprocessing and lightweight feature shaping before invoking the SageMaker runtime, wired with least-privilege IAM so each component can perform only the actions it needs. Persist prediction records and key request metadata in DynamoDB for traceability. Expose operational and performance telemetry in CloudWatch (invocations, latency, error rates, throughput metrics, and custom drift indicators). Route drift and health events through EventBridge so they can trigger alerts and follow-up actions. Keep data encrypted at rest and in transit, scope security groups and resource policies narrowly, and tag resources consistently for ownership and cost. The response must be only the CDK JavaScript code using ES modules in three files—`bin/tap.mjs`, `lib/tap-stack.mjs`, and `cdk.json`—with no explanations, no comments, and nothing else.
