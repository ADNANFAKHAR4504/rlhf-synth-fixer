  "training_quality": 7,
  "training_quality_justification": "This task demonstrates substantial training value (7/10) for several reasons: (1) It required fixing multiple critical infrastructure issues including Vault provider removal, encryption configuration, KMS policy corrections, and service account handling; (2) The MODEL_FAILURES.md documents 7 major categories of fixes with 15+ specific corrections, showing significant deviation between initial response and working solution; (3) The task covers complex real-world scenarios like HIPAA compliance, proper secrets management fallbacks, and AWS service integration nuances; (4) The fixes address both common mistakes (hardcoded AMIs, missing data sources) and subtle issues (ELB service account permissions, KMS encryption contexts); (5) However, it's not a 9-10 because the task itself is relatively standard infrastructure setup - the learning value comes more from fixing mistakes than from novel architectural patterns.",
