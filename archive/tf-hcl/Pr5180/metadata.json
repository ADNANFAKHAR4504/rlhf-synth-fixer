Implements complete auto-scaling, monitoring, security (GDPR-compliant encryption), backup lifecycle management, and operational event capture. The initial model response had critical issues including missing environment_suffix for CI/CD isolation, outdated Aurora version, Performance Insights incompatibility with db.serverless instances, missing Lambda function implementation, IAM wildcard permissions violating least privilege, missing SNS topic policy for EventBridge, and incomplete resource dependencies. The ideal response addresses all issues with production-ready infrastructure following AWS best practices.",
