The solution creates a secure VPC with public subnets across multiple availability zones, internet gateway, route tables, security groups, and IAM roles with proper permissions for EC2 instances. The infrastructure follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles with comprehensive tagging, variable-driven configuration, and proper resource dependencies. All resources are tested with 126 comprehensive unit and integration tests ensuring production readiness and compliance with security best practices.",
