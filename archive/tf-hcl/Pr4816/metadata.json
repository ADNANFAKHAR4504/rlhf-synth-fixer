  "background": "This task requires implementing a secure, production-grade AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The implementation must include multi-AZ high availability, encryption at rest and in transit, comprehensive monitoring and compliance features, and follow AWS security best practices. All infrastructure must be defined in a single Terraform file without external modules, with complete implementations including inline Lambda functions for secret rotation. The solution demonstrates enterprise-level infrastructure-as-code capabilities with comprehensive security, compliance, and governance features.",
