  "background": "This task involves creating a production-ready, highly available web application infrastructure in AWS us-west-2 region using Terraform. The infrastructure spans 2 Availability Zones and includes VPC with public/private subnets, dual NAT Gateways for high availability, EC2 instances with Apache web server, RDS Multi-AZ MySQL database, S3 bucket with encryption and versioning, comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring with 6 alarms, and IAM roles following least privilege principle. The solution has been validated with 134 automated tests (101 unit tests + 33 integration tests) achieving 100% pass rate with no mocking. All security best practices are implemented including encryption at rest, network segmentation, private database placement, and public access blocks on S3.",
