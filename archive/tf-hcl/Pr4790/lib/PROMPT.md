A publisher needs a secure, low-latency delivery setup for about ten thousand e-books per day with strict access controls and reliable access logs. Define the entire stack in Terraform and return only a single file named tap_stack.tf; the response must be only code with no explanations, no comments, and nothing extra. Store e-books in an S3 bucket with all public access blocked and at-rest encryption using KMS. Put a CloudFront distribution in front of the bucket and use an Origin Access Identity so only CloudFront can read objects. Provision an HTTPS certificate in ACM and attach it to the distribution, and create a Route 53 record that points your domain to the CloudFront distribution. Send detailed CloudFront access logs to a dedicated S3 logging bucket encrypted with KMS, and surface delivery metrics in CloudWatch. Keep IAM policies least-privilege across access to content, logs, and keys. The final output for stack must be a complete, valid Terraform configuration in tap_stack.tf, code only.
