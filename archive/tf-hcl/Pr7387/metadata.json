It demonstrates infrastructure-as-code best practices for deploying consistent environments across us-east-1 and eu-west-1 regions. The solution includes VPC networking with public/private subnets, RDS PostgreSQL databases, Application Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups with launch templates, S3 buckets with encryption, KMS keys for security, Secrets Manager for password management, IAM roles and policies, and CloudWatch logging. The infrastructure supports both development and production environments with environment-specific configurations and comprehensive integration testing using real AWS SDK calls with graceful fallback to Terraform configuration validation.",
