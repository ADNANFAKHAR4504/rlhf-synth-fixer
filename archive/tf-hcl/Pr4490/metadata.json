  "background": "Design and implement a production-grade, secure AWS infrastructure using Terraform for a multi-account environment. The solution includes comprehensive security services: AWS Secrets Manager for credential management with KMS encryption, AWS Config for compliance tracking, GuardDuty for threat detection, Shield Advanced for DDoS protection, multi-region CloudTrail for audit logging, VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring, and automated security group change tracking using Lambda and EventBridge. All resources use customer-managed KMS keys with automatic rotation, encrypted S3 buckets for logs, IAM roles with MFA enforcement, and follow security best practices. The implementation is delivered as a single consolidated Terraform file with 160 comprehensive tests (141 unit + 19 integration) achieving 100% pass rate.",
