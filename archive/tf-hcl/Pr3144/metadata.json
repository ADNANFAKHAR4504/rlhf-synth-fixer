  "training_quality_justification": "High training value due to: (1) Complex multi-service security architecture demonstrating advanced AWS security patterns, (2) Multiple critical infrastructure failures requiring sophisticated debugging (S3 policy lockout, regional compatibility, service-to-service permissions), (3) Real-world lessons in balancing security with operational requirements, (4) Comprehensive coverage of 13+ AWS services with proper integration patterns, (5) Demonstrates importance of regional testing and AWS API validation rules. The model's original response had 11 distinct failures across high/medium/low severity, providing excellent learning opportunities for security hardening, regional service availability, and Terraform best practices.",
