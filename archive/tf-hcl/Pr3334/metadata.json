  "training_quality": 6,
  "training_quality_justification": "The model demonstrated good understanding of complex multi-service AWS infrastructure with proper architecture design, security features (KMS, Secrets Manager, VPC Flow Logs), and Multi-AZ RDS. However, it made a critical Terraform syntax error using 'log_destination_arn' instead of 'log_destination' for VPC Flow Log configuration, preventing deployment. This represents a valuable training example showing a common mistake with specific resource argument names, making it moderately valuable (6/10) for improving the model's knowledge of Terraform AWS provider syntax and argument naming conventions.",
