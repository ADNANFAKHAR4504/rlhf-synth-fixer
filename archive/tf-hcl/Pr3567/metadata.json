  "training_quality_justification": "Moderate training value. Demonstrates complex multi-region Terraform architecture with proper correction of AWS resource naming constraints (ALB/Target Group name_prefix length limit). Provides clear before/after comparison for learning from mistakes. However, the error type is a basic validation issue that shouldn't occur in a well-trained model. Limited novelty as multi-region setups are common patterns, though the specific 6-character name_prefix constraint is a valuable edge case.",
