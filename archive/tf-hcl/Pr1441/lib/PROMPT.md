# AWS Infrastructure Project

## Context
You are tasked with creating and managing a cloud environment in AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure includes VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS databases, and IAM roles.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Terraform HCL Configuration
- Define all resources using Terraform HCL format
- Create comprehensive Terraform configuration files
- Use proper variable definitions and outputs
- Structure code in a modular, reusable way

### 2. Cloud Provider Configuration
- Use appropriate Terraform providers for AWS
- Configure AWS provider with proper authentication
- Implement proper provider credentials management
- Set up provider version constraints

### 3. Network Configuration
- Configure VPCs with proper CIDR blocks
- Set up IP addresses and subnets correctly
- Implement proper routing and security groups
- Configure network access controls

### 4. Resource Management
- Deploy EC2 instances with proper configurations
- Set up RDS databases with appropriate settings
- Configure IAM roles with least privilege permissions
- Ensure all resources are properly configured and functional

### 5. Security and Access Control
- Configure IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- Implement basic authentication and authorization
- Set up access controls for resources
- Follow security best practices

### 6. Rollback and Recovery
- Ensure there is a basic rollback plan for changes
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback procedures

### 7. Validation and Testing
- Validate infrastructure with Terraform `plan` and `apply` commands
- Test resources for functionality
- Verify network connectivity
- Perform testing before deployment

## Deliverables

### Documentation
- Infrastructure plan and procedures
- Basic rollback procedures
- Network configuration documentation
- Security configuration documentation

### Testing and Validation
- Terraform plan and apply validation
- Resource functionality testing
- Network connectivity testing
- Basic security testing

## Success Criteria
- All AWS resources successfully deployed and configured
- Network configurations properly implemented
- IAM roles configured with appropriate permissions
- Rollback procedures documented
- All Terraform commands execute successfully
- Infrastructure functions as expected
