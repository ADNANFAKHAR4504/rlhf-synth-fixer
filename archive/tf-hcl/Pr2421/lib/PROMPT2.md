I've received the following error when trying to validate or plan the file you created "expected enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports.2 to be one of ["agent" "alert" "audit" "diag.log" "error" "general" "iam-db-auth-error" "listener" "notify.log" "oemagent" "postgresql" "slowquery" "trace" "upgrade"], got slow_query" in both resources from use1 or usw2. Please fix it and return the file to me. Also instead of creating a user_data.sh file, put it inside the main.tf file. Thank you.
