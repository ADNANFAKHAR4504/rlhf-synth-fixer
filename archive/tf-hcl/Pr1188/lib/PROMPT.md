## Foundational AWS cloud environment
You are tasked with setting up a cloud environment using Terraform.Standard AWS best practices for security and scalability should be followed. Creating an Amazon RDS MySQL database with automated backup settings, ensuring secure storage of credentials. Provisioning an Amazon EC2 instance using the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI, placed within a public subnet that allows SSH access securely. All resources should be defined using Terraform 1.0 HCL syntax and should be placed in the 'us-east-2' region. Use Terraform variables to manage sensitive information like database credentials and the EC2 instance type. Store your Terraform state file remotely in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled for state management. Ensure adherence to AWS best practices throughout the deployment.Output the configuration as a single `main.tf` file with all the resources above.
