Infrastructure includes API Gateway REST API with Lambda authorizers and 10,000 req/sec throttling, three Lambda functions (event ingestion, processing, storage) using ARM-based Graviton2 processors with reserved concurrency, DynamoDB tables with composite primary keys and GSI for state storage, SQS queues with DLQ for reliable message delivery, EventBridge rules with content-based filtering for event orchestration, SSM Parameter Store for cross-function configuration, CloudWatch Logs with 7-day retention and custom metrics, and X-Ray distributed tracing across all components. System maintains strict data consistency and audit trails with point-in-time recovery, server-side encryption on all storage resources, and least-privilege IAM policies.",
