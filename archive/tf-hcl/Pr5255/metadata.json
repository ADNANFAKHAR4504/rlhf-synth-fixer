  "background": "Hub-and-spoke network architecture implementation for a financial services company launching digital banking services. The infrastructure handles centralized networking with three VPCs (hub, production, development) connected via AWS Transit Gateway, supporting complete spoke isolation for security. Key features include centralized internet egress through NAT Gateways in the hub VPC (cost savings), centralized DNS resolution via Route53 Resolver endpoints, VPC Flow Logs to S3 with lifecycle policies (30-day Glacier transition, 365-day retention), Systems Manager VPC endpoints for secure instance management, and DHCP option sets for internal DNS. The architecture is designed for scalability with modular Terraform code, enabling easy addition of new spoke VPCs while maintaining strict security boundaries through Transit Gateway blackhole routes that prevent direct spoke-to-spoke communication. Multi-AZ deployment across 3 availability zones ensures high availability, with comprehensive tagging strategy for cost allocation and resource management.",
