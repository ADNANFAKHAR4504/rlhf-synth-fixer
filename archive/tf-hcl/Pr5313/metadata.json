Implements Transit Gateway with cross-region peering to enable secure communication between regions, with centralized DNS via Route53 private hosted zones, VPC Flow Logs to S3 for compliance, Systems Manager VPC endpoints for secure instance management, and production/non-production traffic isolation using separate Transit Gateway route tables. Includes NAT Gateways for regional internet egress, state management with S3 backend and DynamoDB locking to prevent concurrent modifications, and modular Terraform design for easy expansion to additional regions.",
