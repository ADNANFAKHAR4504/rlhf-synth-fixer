# This file is automatically loaded by Terraform
# It reads the environment_suffix from the TF_VAR_environment_suffix environment variable
# The bootstrap/deploy scripts should set this variable

# Note: This file intentionally has no direct variable assignments
# because Terraform will look for TF_VAR_environment_suffix environment variable
# If that's not set, the scripts should pass -var="environment_suffix=${ENVIRONMENT_SUFFIX}"
