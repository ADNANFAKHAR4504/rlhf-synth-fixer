## Multi-Region Terraform AWS Infrastructure

You are tasked with designing a Terraform configuration for provisioning a cloud environment in AWS that spans multiple regions. The specific regions to be covered are **us-east-2** and **us-west-2**. The design must include the creation of VPCs, subnets, Internet Gateways, and any directly related networking resources. The AWS resources must follow the naming convention: `project-resource-environment` where `project` is the project name, `resource` is the resource type, and `environment` is the deployment environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). The project must support multiple regions, and the code must be output to a single `main.tf` file under `lib/main.tf`. Do not create any external modules or add additional explanations or documentation. Assume we already have a `provider.tf` and don't add the provider code to the `main.tf` file. We will use provider aliases for multi-region deployment.
