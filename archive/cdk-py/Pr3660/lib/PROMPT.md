Help write an AWS CDK application in Python that deploys a fully serverless API for managing inventory to support approximately 3,000 daily orders. The solution should be designed to prioritize cost efficiency, security, and rapid deployment, ensuring it can be easily maintained and scaled as the workload grows.
The API should use Amazon API Gateway (REST API) as the primary entry point. It must integrate with AWS Lambda functions (Python 3.9) that implement the core inventory management operations such as creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting items. The architecture should ensure that the API is stateless, scalable, and able to handle variable request volumes.
Amazon DynamoDB should be provisioned as the backend data store, configured with auto-scaling to handle spikes in traffic without incurring unnecessary costs. The schema should be flexible enough to manage typical inventory operations efficiently. To maintain secure communication between resources, IAM roles and policies must be defined carefully, applying the principle of least privilege.
Configuration details, such as environment variables or sensitive settings, should be stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for security and ease of management. CloudWatch should be configured to capture logs and provide basic performance metrics for both API Gateway and Lambda, enabling visibility into system behavior and quick troubleshooting.
The overall design must emphasize simplicity, security, and cost-effectiveness. It should deploy reliably without errors, and provide a production-ready foundation for the startup’s inventory management needs.
