The solution includes a complete serverless stack with API Gateway, Lambda functions, S3 storage, DynamoDB for metadata, and proper security configurations using KMS encryption. The implementation follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles with proper IAM roles, monitoring, logging, and error handling. It serves as an excellent example of Infrastructure as Code using CDK Python for building scalable, secure, and cost-effective serverless applications.",
