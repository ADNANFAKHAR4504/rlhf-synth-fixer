I want you to design and implement a complete serverless infrastructure using the AWS CDK in Python (main.py - single stack). The setup should revolve around a DynamoDB table that has streams enabled, with a Lambda function that automatically processes those stream records whenever new changes occur. The Lambda should be written in TypeScript and should be responsible for parsing the incoming records, handling errors gracefully, and sending anything that fails processing into a dead letter queue in SQS.

The Lambda function should have proper permissions through IAM — only what it needs, nothing extra. It’ll need access to the DynamoDB stream, CloudWatch for logging, and SQS for the DLQ. I also want this infrastructure to expose a simple API Gateway endpoint that can invoke the Lambda function on demand, secured with resource policies so only certain IP ranges can call it. All API activity should be logged and monitored through CloudWatch, and API Gateway caching should be encrypted at rest.

Finally, make sure the whole setup can handle high load scenarios and scale accordingly. The end result should be a single AWS CDK stack, written in Python, that defines all of this and can deploy cleanly in any supported AWS region without manual configuration.
