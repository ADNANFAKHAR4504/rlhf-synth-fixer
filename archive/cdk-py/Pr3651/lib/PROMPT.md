I need you to build a complete serverless application on AWS using the CDK in Python (main.py - single stack). Everything should deploy in the `us-east-1` region. The application is meant for managing user data, and it should be highly available, scalable, and as hands-off as possible once deployed.

At the center of this setup will be a Lambda function (or more than one, if you find that cleaner) that handles user-related operations. The functions should use the latest Node.js runtime available on AWS, have a 30-second timeout, and be instrumented with AWS X-Ray so we can trace performance and issues. Also, please add a dead-letter queue using SQS to catch any failed invocations for later analysis.

We’ll expose these functions through an API Gateway that handles HTTP requests and supports CORS. The API should have multiple stages — specifically `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` — so we can test and promote changes easily. Make sure every request going through API Gateway is logged to CloudWatch, and that CORS is properly enabled for all methods.

For data storage, use DynamoDB. The table should use On-Demand capacity mode and have a composite primary key: `userId` (string) as the partition key and `createdDate` (string) as the sort key.

All logs generated by the application (Lambda and API Gateway) should be stored in an S3 bucket. That bucket needs versioning turned on and server-side encryption enabled for security.

On top of that, add a CloudFront distribution in front of the API Gateway to help with global caching and faster response times. Use IAM roles configured according to the principle of least privilege — only give services and functions the permissions they actually need.

I also want monitoring built in. Set up a CloudWatch alarm that will alert us if a Lambda function’s average execution time goes above 25 seconds. Tag all resources with `Environment: Production` so we can track them for cost allocation.

In short, the CDK stack should wire all of this together — Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, SQS, IAM — in a clean and secure way, all defined using AWS CDK in Python and ready to deploy with `cdk deploy`.
