⚠️ Failure Modeling Prompt for Serverless Application
🎯 Objective

Model failure scenarios in a serverless application using AWS Lambda, S3, and CDK (Python). The goal is to proactively identify and design for failure conditions to improve resilience, observability, and error handling in production.
💡 Scenario Overview

We are building a serverless application using:

    AWS Lambda: core compute engine

    Amazon S3: triggers Lambda via event notifications

    AWS CDK (Python): infrastructure as code

    CloudWatch: logging and alerting

    Environment Variables: runtime configuration

    Region: us-east-1
