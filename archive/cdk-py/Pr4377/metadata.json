Critical Issues: (1) Missing required sample data population feature explicitly requested in PROMPT, (2) MODEL_FAILURES.md claims this was fixed but implementation is absent, (3) Inconsistency between documented fixes and actual code reduces training value. Needs improvement to meet minimum quality threshold of 8/10.",
