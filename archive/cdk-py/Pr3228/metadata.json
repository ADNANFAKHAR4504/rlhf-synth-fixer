  "training_quality_justification": "Moderate training value. The conversation demonstrates good serverless infrastructure patterns with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB integration, along with important security improvements (IAM least privilege, X-Ray tracing). The MODEL_FAILURES.md documents substantial fixes in security, performance, and maintainability. However, training quality is reduced due to: (1) IDEAL_RESPONSE.md is improperly formatted and less comprehensive than MODEL_RESPONSE.md, (2) some fixes mentioned in MODEL_FAILURES.md (pagination, caching, on-demand capacity) are not actually implemented in the IDEAL_RESPONSE, (3) missing integration tests to validate the solution, and (4) the solution removes helpful examples and documentation that were in MODEL_RESPONSE. The data provides value for learning serverless CDK patterns and security best practices, but the incomplete nature and format issues limit its effectiveness for model retraining.",
