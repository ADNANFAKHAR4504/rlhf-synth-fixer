> **Act as an AWS Solution Architect**. Create an AWS CDK application in Python that deploys a secure serverless application with the following requirements:
>
> 1. Implement an AWS Lambda function using a Python runtime (e.g., `python3.11`) that returns a simple JSON response.
> 2. Set up an Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API) to trigger the Lambda function on HTTP requests.

> 4. Follow AWS IAM best practices by creating a Lambda execution role with the **least privileges** required (e.g., CloudWatch logging only).

>
> **Expected Output:** Provide the full AWS CDK Python project source code in app.py file:
