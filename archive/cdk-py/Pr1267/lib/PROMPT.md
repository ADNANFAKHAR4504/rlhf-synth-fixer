Using AWS CDK in Python, design and deploy a web application on AWS that meets the following requirements:

    Application Load Balancer (ALB): Deploy the web application behind an AWS Application Load Balancer to manage incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

    Amazon RDS (MySQL): Provision an Amazon RDS MySQL database instance for storing application data.

    IAM Roles and Policies: Configure IAM roles and policies to ensure all AWS resources follow the principle of least privilege.

    Auto Scaling: Implement Auto Scaling groups and policies to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demand.

    Monitoring and Logging: Use AWS CloudWatch to collect logs and monitor metrics for both the application and infrastructure components.
