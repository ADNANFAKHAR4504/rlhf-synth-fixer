Hey there! We need to set up a serverless infrastructure using AWS CDK with Python (main.py - single stack). The goal is to deploy a Lambda function (using Python 3 runtime) that gets triggered by an API Gateway REST endpoint. The Lambda function should interact with a DynamoDB table to store data, and the table must have a primary key with provisioned throughput of 5 read and 5 write capacity units.

We also need to make sure that CloudWatch Logs are set up to monitor the Lambda function's execution. The API Gateway should support CORS so that client-side applications can interact with it seamlessly. Additionally, all resources should be tagged with `Environment: EnvironmentSuffix` and deployed in the `us-west-2` AWS region.

IAM roles and policies are critical here. The Lambda function must have the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB and log to CloudWatch. Finally, the CloudFormation stack should include a description summarizing its purpose, and we need to output the Lambda function's ARN and the API Gateway's URL after deployment.
