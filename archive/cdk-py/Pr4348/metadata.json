  "training_quality": 9,
  "training_quality_justification": "Excellent training value. The MODEL_RESPONSE showed significant knowledge gaps with incomplete code (cut off mid-implementation across 3 attempts), over-engineered architecture with 10+ separate stacks, no actual multi-region support despite requirements, zero testing implementation, and broken cross-stack dependencies. The IDEAL_RESPONSE demonstrates proper nested stack patterns, working multi-region deployment with cross_region_references, pragmatic solutions to real AWS constraints (RDS identifier length limits with MD5 hashing), successful blue-green deployment with CodeDeploy, functional Route53 failover, and comprehensive integration tests. The MODEL_FAILURES.md provides extensive analysis of architectural mistakes, implementation gaps, and testing challenges. This represents valuable learning about CDK nested stacks, multi-region patterns, resource discovery, and the critical importance of integration testing for infrastructure validation. Score: 9/10 - High complexity task with clear before/after comparison showing significant model improvement areas.",
