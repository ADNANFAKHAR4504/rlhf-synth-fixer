Create an AWS CDK v2 Python stack to deploy a reliable asynchronous processing system for a logistics app handling 25,000 daily tracking updates. Requirements: use SQS (standard or FIFO as appropriate) as the ingest queue and a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ); a Lambda (Python 3.12) consumer that processes messages and writes logs to DynamoDB (audit trail), with strict IAM least-privilege for all roles; CloudWatch metrics and alarms for queue depth, age of oldest message, Lambda errors, and throttles; EventBridge rules for operational alerts and scheduled jobs; encryption at rest (KMS) for SQS/DynamoDB artifacts, and tagging for Environment/Project. The stack must set sensible timeouts, retries, batching, visibility timeout / redrive policy, idempotency guidance for Lambda, and outputs for SQS URLs, Lambda name, DynamoDB table name, and monitoring resources. Produce a complete deployable CDK Python program.

Expected outputs: single stack(tap_stack.py)
