Design a real-time IoT analytics system for a smart city with 50,000 traffic sensors using AWS CDK (Python). Implement:

IoT Core for secure sensor ingestion
Kinesis for real-time data streaming
Lambda for stream processing and analytics
DynamoDB for storing processed traffic data
QuickSight for dashboards and visualization
EventBridge for congestion alerts
CloudWatch for monitoring and metrics
IAM for secure access and least-privilege control
Ensure high availability, fault tolerance, real-time insights, and secure communication between components.

Expected Output: Single stack(tap_stack.py)
