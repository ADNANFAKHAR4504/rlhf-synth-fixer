Requirements:

Region & Environment

Deploy all resources in the us-east-1 region.

Target the pre-production environment.

Naming Convention

Use the format: project-env-resource (e.g., webapp-preprod-s3).

Cost Optimization

Prioritize serverless and low-cost AWS services such as:

S3 for static assets or storage.

DynamoDB for NoSQL storage needs.

Lambda for compute tasks.

Ensure each service is suitable for the workload it supports.

Design Focus

Keep the infrastructure simple, efficient, and cost-effective.

Avoid over-provisioning or unnecessary managed services.
