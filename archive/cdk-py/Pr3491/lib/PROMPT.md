I’d like you to put together a CDK project in Python that sets up a simple serverless backend in AWS, . The main piece is a Lambda function written in TypeScript that will handle requests, and I want that function invoked through an API Gateway REST API. The API needs to expose an `/items` path where GET will fetch data and POST will create new items. Whenever POST is called, the data should be stored in S3, and every response coming out of the Lambda should be JSON.

The Lambda has to be wired with the right IAM role so it only gets the basic execution policy plus S3 permissions it actually needs. Any configuration should be passed into the Lambda through environment variables instead of hardcoding. I also want CloudWatch logging turned on so I can see both API Gateway requests and responses.

Please write the solution as an AWS CDK app in Python(app.py - single stack), using good IaC practices. That means having an `app.py` and a stack class that provisions all the resources (Lambda, API Gateway, IAM role, S3 bucket, CloudWatch logs, domain, etc.). The stack should be easy to parameterize for things like the IP allowlist, environment variables, the S3 bucket name, and the custom domain details. Basically, I want to be able to deploy this with CDK synth/deploy and have a working serverless system that matches the description without having to manually tweak things afterward.
