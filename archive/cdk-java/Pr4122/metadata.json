  "training_quality": 6,
  "training_quality_justification": "The MODEL_RESPONSE demonstrated strong AWS security knowledge and comprehensive service coverage, but required significant architectural refactoring. Key improvements needed: (1) Stack architecture - model created improper nested stacks instead of proper CDK hierarchy with separate DataStack and MonitoringStack; (2) Incomplete integrations - WAF was created but never associated with API Gateway; (3) Production code gaps - Lambda lacked error handling, security headers, and dual storage (DynamoDB + S3); (4) Configuration management - missing type-safe configuration classes; (5) Runtime issues - used Python 3.11 instead of more stable 3.9, inconsistent environment variable naming. However, the model correctly implemented: KMS encryption with rotation, GuardDuty with 15-min frequency, multi-region CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, proper security groups (no 0.0.0.0/0 SSH), DynamoDB point-in-time recovery, and RDS encryption. The MODEL_FAILURES.md provides valuable training data showing the gap between theoretical security knowledge and production-ready implementation patterns. Overall: Good starting point requiring moderate refactoring (Rating: 6/10).",
