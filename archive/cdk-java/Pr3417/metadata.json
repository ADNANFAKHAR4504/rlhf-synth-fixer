  "training_quality": 8,
  "training_quality_justification": "This dataset provides substantial training value (8/10) for several reasons: (1) Complex multi-service architecture demonstrating real-world serverless patterns with WebSocket APIs, document collaboration, and conflict resolution; (2) The model failure teaches critical lessons about requirement adherence - the model ignored explicit Gradle requirement and provided Maven, highlighting the importance of following user constraints; (3) Comprehensive AWS service integration showing proper use of DynamoDB Streams, ElastiCache, OpenSearch, Step Functions, EventBridge in a cohesive system; (4) The correction from multi-stack to single-stack approach demonstrates pragmatic infrastructure design decisions; (5) The shift from complex Java Lambda handlers to inline Python code shows deployment optimization strategies. The extensive MODEL_FAILURES.md document (949 lines) provides detailed analysis of what went wrong and why, making this an excellent learning example. However, it's not a perfect 10 because: (a) the original model response was fundamentally flawed requiring complete rebuild, and (b) some architectural decisions in the correction (like removing AppSync) were simplifications rather than improvements.",
