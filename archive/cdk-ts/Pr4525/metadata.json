  "training_quality_justification": "Excellent training value with significant model improvements: (1) Fixed 9 TypeScript syntax errors including optional props handling and deprecated API usage, (2) Implemented comprehensive end-to-end encryption with customer-managed KMS keys across all services (DynamoDB, Lambda logs, API Gateway logs, SQS, SNS), (3) Enhanced security with key rotation and proper IAM policies, (4) Upgraded runtime to Node.js 20 and latest Lambda Insights, (5) Fixed API Gateway request validation patterns (GET vs POST method handling), (6) Added comprehensive input validation and error handling, (7) Implemented AWS SDK v3 with retry logic and proper configuration. MODEL_FAILURES.md documents substantial infrastructure improvements from basic implementation to production-ready solution with security best practices. All task requirements met correctly with modular construct architecture.",
