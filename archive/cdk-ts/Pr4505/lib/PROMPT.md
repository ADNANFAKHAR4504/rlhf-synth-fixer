An enterprise requires a secure, high-performance hybrid cloud setup that connects its on-premises data center with AWS at 10 Gbps throughput. The environment must maintain redundancy, ensure encryption in transit, and provide real-time monitoring. Integration with the company’s existing identity systems is essential. Use AWS CDK with TypeScript to define the entire hybrid cloud infrastructure and deploy via CloudFormation.

The setup should include a VPC with appropriate subnets and route tables to manage private and public workloads. Establish hybrid connectivity using a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) for VPN termination, and a Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW) to provide high-bandwidth private connectivity to AWS. Implement a Site-to-Site VPN connection with redundant tunnels for fault tolerance. Use a Transit Gateway to manage routing between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks efficiently. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network visibility and send them to CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting on connection health. Integrate Route 53 Resolver for hybrid DNS resolution and forwarders, ensuring seamless communication between environments. Configure IAM roles and policies to securely control access, integrating with corporate SSO or identity providers for unified authentication and authorization.

The output must be only the TypeScript CDK code across three files — bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json — with no explanations, no comments, and nothing else.
