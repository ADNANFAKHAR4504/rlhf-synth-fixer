## Background
A financial services company needs to process real-time payment notifications from multiple third-party providers. The system must handle webhook events, validate payment signatures, and trigger downstream processing workflows while maintaining PCI compliance standards.

## Problem Statement
Create a CDK TypeScript program to build a serverless event processing system for payment webhooks. The configuration must: 1. Create three Lambda functions: webhook receiver (validates signatures), event processor (transforms data), and notification handler (sends alerts). 3. Configure DynamoDB table for storing processed events with GSI for querying by payment provider and timestamp. 4. Set up SQS queues for reliable message delivery between Lambda functions with visibility timeout of 6 times the Lambda timeout. 5. Implement EventBridge custom event bus for routing processed payments to different targets based on payment amount thresholds. 6. Create SNS topic for sending email notifications to operations team for failed payments above $10,000. 7. Configure CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors exceeding 1% error rate and DynamoDB throttling. 8. Implement Lambda function URLs for health check endpoints that bypass API Gateway. 10. Create CloudWatch dashboard displaying API latency, Lambda invocations, and DynamoDB consumed capacity. 11. Configure S3 bucket for storing webhook payload archives with lifecycle policy to transition to Glacier after 90 days. 12.

## Constraints and Requirements
- Follow AWS security best practices

## Environment Setup
Serverless infrastructure deployed in us-east-1 using API Gateway REST API, Lambda functions with Node.js 18 runtime on ARM architecture, DynamoDB for state management, SQS for message queuing, and EventBridge for event routing. Requires CDK 2.x with TypeScript, Node.js 18+, and AWS CLI configured. Uses Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration management with KMS encryption. All Lambda functions deployed in VPC with private subnets for database access. CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging with 30-day retention.

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Platform Requirements
- Use cdk as the IaC framework
- All code must be written in ts
- Follow cdk best practices for resource organization
- Ensure all resources use the `environmentSuffix` variable for naming

### Security and Compliance
- Implement encryption at rest for all data stores using AWS KMS
- Enable encryption in transit using TLS/SSL
- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and policies
- Enable logging and monitoring using CloudWatch
- Tag all resources appropriately

### Testing
- Write unit tests with good coverage
- Integration tests must validate end-to-end workflows using deployed resources
- Load test outputs from `cfn-outputs/flat-outputs.json`

### Resource Management
- Infrastructure should be fully destroyable for CI/CD workflows
- **Important**: Secrets should be fetched from existing Secrets Manager entries, not created
- Avoid DeletionPolicy: Retain unless required

## Deployment Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Resource Naming
- **MANDATORY**: All named resources MUST include `environmentSuffix` in their names
- Pattern: `{resource-name}-${environmentSuffix}` or `{resource-name}-${props.environmentSuffix}`
- Examples:
  - S3 Bucket: `my-bucket-${environmentSuffix}`
  - Lambda Function: `my-function-${environmentSuffix}`
  - DynamoDB Table: `my-table-${environmentSuffix}`
- **Validation**: Every resource with a `name`, `bucketName`, `functionName`, `tableName`, `roleName`, `queueName`, `topicName`, `streamName`, `clusterName`, or `dbInstanceIdentifier` property MUST include environmentSuffix

### Resource Lifecycle
- **MANDATORY**: All resources MUST be destroyable after testing
- **FORBIDDEN**:
  - `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN` (CDK/CDKTF) → Use `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` instead
  - `DeletionPolicy: Retain` (CloudFormation) → Remove or use `Delete`
  - `deletionProtection: true` (RDS, DynamoDB) → Use `deletionProtection: false`
  - `skip_final_snapshot: false` (RDS) → Use `skip_final_snapshot: true`
- **Rationale**: CI/CD needs to clean up resources after testing

### AWS Service-Specific Requirements

#### GuardDuty
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT create GuardDuty detectors in code
- GuardDuty allows only ONE detector per AWS account/region
- If task requires GuardDuty, add comment: "GuardDuty should be enabled manually at account level"

#### AWS Config
- **CRITICAL**: If creating AWS Config roles, use correct managed policy:
  - CORRECT: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWS_ConfigRole`
  - WRONG: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/ConfigRole`
  - WRONG: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWS_ConfigRole`
- **Alternative**: Use service-linked role `AWSServiceRoleForConfig` (auto-created)

#### Lambda Functions
- **Node.js 18.x+**: Do NOT use `require('aws-sdk')` - AWS SDK v2 not available
  - Use AWS SDK v3: `import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'`
  - Or extract data from event object directly
- **Reserved Concurrency**: Avoid setting `reservedConcurrentExecutions` unless required
  - If required, use low values (1-5) to avoid account limit issues

#### CloudWatch Synthetics
- **CRITICAL**: Use current runtime version
  - CORRECT: `synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_7_0`
  - WRONG: `SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_5_1` (deprecated)

#### RDS Databases
- **Prefer**: Aurora Serverless v2 (faster provisioning, auto-scaling)
- **If Multi-AZ required**: Set `backup_retention_period = 1` (minimum) and `skip_final_snapshot = true`
- **Note**: Multi-AZ RDS takes 20-30 minutes to provision

#### NAT Gateways
- **Cost Warning**: NAT Gateways cost approximately $32/month each
- **Prefer**: VPC Endpoints for S3, DynamoDB (free)
- **If NAT required**: Create only 1 NAT Gateway (not per AZ) for synthetic tasks

### Hardcoded Values (FORBIDDEN)
- **DO NOT** hardcode:
  - Environment names: `prod-`, `dev-`, `stage-`, `production`, `development`, `staging`
  - Account IDs: `123456789012`, `arn:aws:.*:.*:account`
  - Regions: Hardcoded `us-east-1` or `us-west-2` in resource names (use variables)
- **USE**: Environment variables, context values, or parameters instead

### Cross-Resource References
- Ensure all resource references use proper ARNs or resource objects
- Verify dependencies are explicit (use `DependsOn` in CloudFormation, `dependsOn` in CDK)
- Test that referenced resources exist before use

## Code Examples (Reference)

### Correct Resource Naming (CDK TypeScript)
```typescript
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DataBucket', {
  bucketName: `data-bucket-${environmentSuffix}`,  // CORRECT
  // ...
});

// WRONG:
// bucketName: 'data-bucket-prod'  // Hardcoded, will fail
```

### Correct Removal Policy (CDK TypeScript)
```typescript
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DataBucket', {
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,  // CORRECT
  // ...
});

// WRONG:
// removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.RETAIN  // Will block cleanup
```

### Correct AWS Config IAM Role (CDK TypeScript)
```typescript
const configRole = new iam.Role(this, 'ConfigRole', {
  assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('config.amazonaws.com'),
  managedPolicies: [
    iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName(
      'service-role/AWS_ConfigRole'  // CORRECT
    )
  ]
});

// WRONG:
// 'service-role/ConfigRole'  // Policy doesn't exist
// 'AWS_ConfigRole'  // Missing service-role/ prefix
```

## Target Region
Deploy all resources to: **us-east-1**

## Success Criteria
- Infrastructure deploys successfully
- All security and compliance constraints are met
- Tests pass successfully
- Resources are properly tagged and named with environmentSuffix
- Infrastructure can be cleanly destroyed
