  "training_quality_justification": "HIGH VALUE training example. Model made a critical architectural mistake by implementing multi-region Aurora Global Database (us-east-1 + eu-west-1) instead of the required same-region multi-VPC setup (both in us-east-1). This represents a fundamental requirements comprehension failure. The IDEAL_RESPONSE correctly implements the same-region architecture with two independent Aurora clusters in separate VPCs within us-east-1. Key learning: distinction between 'same-region, multi-VPC' vs 'multi-region' disaster recovery patterns. The fix required complete architectural redesign including removal of Global Database, Route53 ARC, and cross-region components. All requirements are met in IDEAL_RESPONSE with proper VPC configuration, Aurora clusters, Lambda functions, monitoring, alerting, and comprehensive testing. Score: 9/10 (excellent training value due to significant architectural correction).",
