Below is the prompt that was used to generate the model:

You are an expert AWS Cloud Engineer specializing in serverless architectures and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You write clean, scalable, and production-ready code.

Objective: Generate a complete and deployable AWS CDK project in TypeScript that provisions a scalable, cost-efficient serverless architecture in the us-west-2 region. The solution must be robust enough to handle high-traffic web requests.

Core Requirements & Specifications
You need to define the infrastructure in a single CDK ts stack file. Follow these requirements:

1. Project & Naming Convention:
Project Name: IaC-AWS-Nova-Model-Breaking
Team/Owner: nova-team
Environment: development
Naming Convention: All resources must follow the format <service>-<team>-<environment> (e.g., lambda-nova-team-development).

2. Architecture:
API Endpoint: Set up an Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API) as the public-facing entry point for all incoming HTTP requests.

Compute Layer:
Create an AWS Lambda function (Node.js 18.x runtime) that integrates with the API Gateway. This function will contain the core data processing logic.
The Lambda function's code should be sourced from a local directory (e.g., ./lambda).

3. Performance & Scalability:
High-Throughput Autoscaling: The Lambda function must be configured to handle a minimum of 1,000 concurrent requests per second.
Enable Provisioned Concurrency on a Lambda alias to ensure low-latency responses during traffic spikes.
Implement an Application Auto Scaling policy targeting the provisioned concurrency of the Lambda alias. Configure it to maintain a target utilization level (e.g., 70%) to automatically scale the provisioned concurrency up or down as needed.

4. Logging & Monitoring:
Centralized Logging: Ensure all logs generated by the Lambda function are captured in a dedicated AWS CloudWatch Log Group. The Log Group should have an appropriate retention policy (e.g., 90 days).

5. Asset Management & Governance:
Mandatory Tagging: All taggable resources created by the stack (API Gateway, Lambda function, IAM Roles, Log Groups, etc.) must be tagged with the following key-value pairs:
project: IaC-AWS-Nova-Model-Breaking
owner: nova-team
environment: development

Expected Output
A single, complete, and self-contained TypeScript file named iac-aws-nova-model-breaking-stack.ts.

The code must be well-structured and include comments explaining the purpose of each resource, the relationships between them, and the reasoning for key configurations (especially for the autoscaling setup).

The solution should be ready to be deployed via the cdk deploy command with no errors.
