A fintech startup needs a CDK (TypeScript) program that deploys a containerized payment processing web application with blue-green capability and strict PCI-DSS controls. Build it for multi-region operation with a primary stack in us-east-1 and a DR stack in eu-west-1, selectable through context parameters. Use ECS Fargate with ARM64 Graviton2 tasks for cost efficiency, fronted by an Application Load Balancer configured with weighted target groups to shift traffic between blue and green during deployments. Protect the ALB with AWS WAF and add a rate-based rule appropriate for payment APIs. Create an Aurora PostgreSQL cluster with Multi-AZ, automatic failover, point-in-time recovery, and SSL/TLS enforced (e.g., rds.force_ssl) so the service layer can implement certificate pinning. Wire Route 53 health checks and DNS failover across the two regions. Enable CloudWatch Container Insights and publish custom metrics for transaction latency; set alarms that trigger an automatic rollback if HTTP 5xx exceeds one percent. Isolate tiers with separate security groups following least-privilege rules (ALB, ECS, RDS). Attach tightly scoped IAM roles, including task roles with permissions boundary policies that confine S3 access to specific buckets. Ensure inter-service traffic uses AWS PrivateLink endpoints rather than public paths. Place the app in a VPC with three Availability Zones, private subnets for ECS and RDS, public subnets for the ALB, and NAT Gateways for egress. Rotate database credentials with Secrets Manager on a 30-day schedule. Use only CDK v2 L2 constructs, keep the design modular with stacks and constructs, and ensure the full deployment, including health checks, completes within fifteen minutes. The response must be the complete CDK TypeScript code files—bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json.
