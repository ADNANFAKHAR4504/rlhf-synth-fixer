However, MODEL_RESPONSE.md contains only placeholder text (-3 points), preventing full training value assessment. Implementation required 8 significant fixes including IAM policies, GitHub webhooks, S3 versioning, CodeBuild caching, security groups, CodeDeploy roles, CloudWatch alarms, and resource naming. Platform/language compliance verified (CDK+TypeScript). PROMPT.md is human-style. environmentSuffix consistently used. All resources destroyable.
