A financial institution needs a highly available, globally distributed data layer that can handle roughly five hundred thousand transactions per day with 99.99% uptime, low-latency reads, strong consistency guarantees, and controls aligned to PCI-DSS. Use AWS CDK with TypeScript to define and deploy an Aurora Global Database spanning us-east-1 (primary) and us-west-1 (secondary) with automatic failover, point-in-time recovery, and backup policies that meet enterprise retention needs. Pair this with DynamoDB Global Tables for metadata replication across both regions, and add ElastiCache (Redis) to cut read latency on hot keys where appropriate. Store all database and cache credentials in Secrets Manager, wire least-privilege IAM roles to each service, and surface operational visibility through CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms. Emit business and operational events with EventBridge, and schedule a Lambda function to orchestrate backup workflows and periodic integrity checks. Use Route 53 health checks and DNS failover so clients are routed to the healthy writer/reader endpoints during regional incidents. Turn on Security Hub and integrate standard detective controls so findings reflect compliance posture, including encryption at rest and in transit, restricted security groups, and configuration hardening. Keep everything encrypted with KMS keys scoped per service and region, ensure subnet placement spans multiple AZs, and isolate traffic through security groups restricted to only what each component needs. Output must be only the CDK TypeScript code for three files—`bin/tap.ts`, `lib/tap-stack.ts`, and `cdk.json`—with no explanations, no comments, and nothing else.
