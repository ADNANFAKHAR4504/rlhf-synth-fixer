  "training_quality_justification": "High-quality training data with real-world serverless patterns. MODEL_FAILURES.md documents 6 critical issues fixed: (1) API Gateway CloudWatch account configuration, (2) DynamoDB composite key query logic using GetCommand incorrectly, (3) Request body validation accepting null/empty data, (4) TypeScript monorepo configuration, (5) Integration test region mismatch, (6) Missing AWS SDK dependencies. The final solution demonstrates production-ready patterns including: proper IAM permissions, CloudWatch alarms with SNS, X-Ray tracing, Lambda Insights, comprehensive CRUD operations, CORS configuration, optional custom domain with ACM/Route53, and 100% test coverage (unit + integration). Strong learning value for: DynamoDB QueryCommand with KeyConditionExpression, API Gateway account-level settings, input validation patterns, and environment-flexible IaC design. Minor deductions for using deprecated CDK APIs (logRetention, pointInTimeRecovery) and hardcoded pagination limits.",
