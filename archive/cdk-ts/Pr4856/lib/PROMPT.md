A news platform requires a personalized content delivery system capable of serving sixty thousand readers daily while maintaining low latency and accurate engagement tracking. The infrastructure should be fully defined in AWS CDK (TypeScript), and the output must be code only — no explanations, comments, or extra text — within a single stack file. Use CloudFront for global content distribution with Lambda@Edge functions to personalize articles dynamically based on user data. Store content in S3, ensuring versioning and encryption for data integrity and security. Maintain user preferences in DynamoDB for quick lookup and scalability. Configure Route 53 for DNS routing, linking custom domains to CloudFront. Use CloudWatch to track engagement metrics and overall system health. Apply IAM roles and policies with least privilege to secure Lambda@Edge and other resources. The final output should synthesize into a deployable stack that supports low-latency personalized delivery for high-traffic environments.
