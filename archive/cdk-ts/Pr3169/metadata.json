  "training_quality_justification": "Training quality score: 5/10. Rationale: The MODEL_RESPONSE provides significant infrastructure coverage (S3, KMS, DynamoDB, Lambda, VPC endpoints, CloudWatch, CloudTrail) demonstrating advanced CDK patterns and enterprise architecture. However, critical implementation gaps severely limit training value: (1) Truncated Lambda code leaves implementation incomplete (2) No actual deduplication algorithm despite claiming support (3) Missing incremental backup logic (4) Incomplete multi-account implementation (5) No actual backup validation system (6) MODEL_FAILURES analysis identifies only ~40% of required functionality delivered. The IDEAL_RESPONSE corrected the infrastructure and added missing components (SQS queuing, proper concurrency handling, comprehensive monitoring), providing moderate improvement on backup orchestration patterns for AWS. The data demonstrates common pitfalls in enterprise backup systems but limited value for advanced optimization techniques. Score: 5 - Moderate training value focused on infrastructure provisioning patterns, but significant gaps in backup logic implementation.",
