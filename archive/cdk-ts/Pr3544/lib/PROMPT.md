A logistics company with twenty thousand vehicles on the road needs to process GPS data streams in real time to provide delivery updates, run analytics, and send alerts if delays occur. The system has to be scalable and highly reliable while remaining manageable through infrastructure as code. Use AWS CDK with TypeScript to build the stack. Kinesis should handle the incoming GPS streams, Lambda will process the data, DynamoDB will track active vehicle information, and S3 should be used to archive raw data. QuickSight will provide analytics, while EventBridge rules should trigger alerts on delays. Monitoring should be handled with CloudWatch, and IAM roles must be designed with least privilege to secure access. The expected output is the full CDK TypeScript code that defines this entire infrastructure. The response must include only the code without any explanations, comments, or additional text.
Output should be the full TypeScript CDK code files required for deployment, with no explanation, no comments, and nothing extra—only the code in a single stack.
