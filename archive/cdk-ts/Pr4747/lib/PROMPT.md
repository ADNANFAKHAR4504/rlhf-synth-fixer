Create a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CDK in TypeScript to deploy a serverless application consisting of an S3 bucket and a Lambda function. All resources must be defined using TypeScript with the AWS CDK, and the deployment stack must be region-agnostic. The pipeline should use AWS CodePipeline for orchestration, with build and deploy stages implemented using AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy. The Lambda function source code must be stored in an S3 bucket that serves as the source for the pipeline, and deployment should be fully automated and triggered by updates to the source code in S3. Implement IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege. The S3 bucket for the deployed application must have versioning enabled with logging configured. The Lambda function must be configured with a dead letter queue (DLQ), environment variables for configuration management, logging enabled, and the ability to handle up to 100,000 requests per minute. Implement a canary deployment strategy for the Lambda function, and integrate AWS Secrets Manager to securely handle any required secrets. Include automated tests that must pass before deployment as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and configure CloudWatch Alarms to monitor Lambda function errors. Ensure all deployed resources are compliant with predefined security standards and adhere to AWS best practices for security and scalability. The main stack definition should be in lib/tap-stack.ts and the main stack called TapStack
