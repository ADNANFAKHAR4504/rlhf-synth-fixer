# Prompt
All resources must be deployed in the 'us-east-1' region. | No security group should allow SSH access from 0.0.0.0/0. | All S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled. | Enable versioning on all S3 buckets. | IAM policies must use least privilege principle. | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be required for the IAM users. | Use VPC endpoints for S3 access to ensure data does not traverse the public internet. | Ensure no S3 bucket is publicly accessible. | Use AWS CDK Typescript to manage groups of related resources. | All data stored in RDS should be encrypted at rest. | Include logging for all actions on IAM roles for security auditing purposes.

**Instructions:**
The infrastructure environment will be deployed within AWS's 'us-east-1' region, adhering strictly to security standards such as IAM least privilege and S3 data encryption. The resources include S3 buckets, IAM users and roles, RDS instances, Security Groups, and VPC endpoints. Best practices for AWS CDK Typescript code structuring will involve using modules. Networking aspects are tailored to ensure secure data handling, employing VPCs for instance segregation and controlled endpoint access.
