  "training_quality_justification": "Excellent training value with significant model improvements: (1) Critical architectural fix - MODEL_RESPONSE attempted single-stack multi-region deployment which is impossible in CDK, IDEAL_RESPONSE correctly implements separate regional stacks; (2) API modernization - fixed deprecated DynamoDB Table to TableV2 with proper Global Table replication; (3) Multiple runtime/validation errors resolved (naming conventions, ALB logs configuration, health checks); (4) Security best practices implemented (encryption, least privilege IAM, network isolation); (5) Complex multi-region, multi-service integration with proper cross-region replication patterns; (6) All requirements met (HA across 2 regions, security groups, S3, DynamoDB Global Tables, IAM, tagging). Minor deduction: some hardcoded 'Production' environment values and broad outbound security rules. Overall demonstrates substantial model knowledge gaps in CDK multi-region patterns and modern AWS API usage.",
