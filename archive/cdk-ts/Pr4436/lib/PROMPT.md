Design and implement a cross-region disaster recovery solution for a mission-critical financial application using CDK. The solution must include active-active database replication, automated failover mechanisms, and global request routing with latency-based routing policies. The system maintains 99.999% availability. The system processes approximately 10,000 transactions per second and requires real-time data consistency across regions. The system must implement custom health checks that validate both infrastructure and application layer health before triggering failover; Data replication lag between areas must not exceed 50ms under normal operation conditions; the Solution must include automated testing that simulates regional failures and validates failover mechanisms. The main stack file should be named tap-stack.ts with a Class TapStack
