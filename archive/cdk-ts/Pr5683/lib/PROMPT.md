A financial services company is performing a phased migration of its transaction processing system from us-east-1 to us-east-2, requiring zero data loss and minimal downtime. The infrastructure should be defined using AWS CDK (TypeScript) for a fully automated and auditable migration process. The setup needs to deploy DynamoDB Global Tables with point-in-time recovery in both regions, and Lambda functions with environment-specific configurations and weighted routing. Use S3 buckets configured for cross-region replication, encrypted with customer-managed KMS keys, and set lifecycle policies for transaction log management. Implement Route 53 health checks and failover routing between regions to maintain application availability during cutover. Configure EventBridge rules to synchronize application state and CloudWatch dashboards to track replication lag and overall health metrics. Manage the migration using Step Functions to orchestrate each phase, including rollback capabilities within fifteen minutes and a 90-day retention of execution history. Apply least-privilege IAM roles for cross-region management, use custom Lambda validators to ensure post-migration data consistency, and notify stakeholders with SNS updates throughout the process. All inter-region communication should be private using VPC endpoints within peered VPCs. The CDK code must maintain modularity, use context-driven configurations, ARM-based Lambdas, and exports with environment-prefixed names. The model must return only code — specifically for bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json — with no explanations, no comments, and nothing else.
