A fintech startup needs a CDK (TypeScript) application that automates configuration synchronization across multiple AWS environments — dev, staging, and production — ensuring consistent infrastructure states, drift detection, and controlled promotion workflows. The system should deploy identical base stacks with environment-specific parameters fetched dynamically from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configuration versions and deployment history must be tracked in DynamoDB using on-demand billing, TTL for 90-day retention, and point-in-time recovery. Lambda functions, running on ARM-based Graviton2 processors, will compare stack outputs and tags every 30 minutes via EventBridge schedules, generating drift detection reports stored in S3 buckets (versioned, SSE-S3 encrypted) with lifecycle policies to transition to Glacier after 30 days. CodeBuild projects, built from ECR-stored Docker images with vulnerability scanning, should promote changes automatically from dev to staging after validation tests. An approval workflow via SNS and Lambda must govern promotion to production. Rollbacks must be handled through CloudFormation stack policies triggered by Lambda on failure. AWS Config rules, backed by custom Lambda evaluators, will enforce compliance across environments. Implement cross-region replication between us-east-1 (primary) and us-west-2 (DR) for DynamoDB and S3. IAM roles should follow least-privilege principles and be environment-specific for deployment automation. CDK must use context variables to drive environment-specific values, employ reusable constructs for environment replication, and use CDK aspects to enforce mandatory tagging across all resources. CDK Pipelines must support self-mutating behavior for continuous environment updates. The system must use AWS SDK v3 with exponential backoff and export stack outputs with environment-prefixed names. The response must contain only the TypeScript CDK code (bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, cdk.json) — no explanations, comments, or extra text.
