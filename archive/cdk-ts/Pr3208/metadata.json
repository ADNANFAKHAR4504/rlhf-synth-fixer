  "training_quality_justification": "High-value training data demonstrating production-ready AWS infrastructure patterns. Shows clear progression from basic implementation to enterprise-ready solution with 8 documented improvements including multi-environment support, comprehensive tagging, stack outputs, inline IAM policies, enhanced user data with IMDSv2, public resource properties, token-safe naming, and modern AMI selection. Excellent training signal for CDK best practices, security improvements, and operational excellence. Not rated 9-10 due to relatively simple infrastructure scope (single EC2, basic VPC, S3) without complex networking or advanced service integration.",
