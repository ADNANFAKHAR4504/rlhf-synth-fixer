A media platform needs a scalable, secure pipeline to process roughly ten thousand video uploads per day, generate thumbnails and multiple output formats, track job progress, and remain reliable across Availability Zones. Use AWS CDK with TypeScript to define the entire stack and deploy via CloudFormation. Store uploads and outputs in S3 with KMS encryption and block public access. Orchestrate the flow with a Lambda function that submits AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs, updates DynamoDB records to track per-asset status and artifacts, and reacts to lifecycle events. Use EventBridge to route MediaConvert state-change notifications and other pipeline events into SQS queues so the Lambda workers can scale safely, with dead-letter queues to capture failures. Configure CloudWatch for metrics, structured logs, and alarms on key components like queue depth, Lambda errors/throttles, and MediaConvert job failures. Apply least-privilege IAM roles for Lambda, MediaConvert, S3, DynamoDB, SQS, and EventBridge, and ensure at-rest encryption across S3, DynamoDB, SQS, and any environment secrets. Target a straightforward multi-AZ posture by relying on regional services and, if you wire a VPC, spread subnets across at least two AZs for Lambda concurrency resilience. The output should be only the CDK TypeScript code for three files—bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json—with no explanations, no comments, and nothing extra.
