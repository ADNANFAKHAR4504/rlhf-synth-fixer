I am facing these issues during deployment:

1.  `CREATE_FAILED | AWS::IAM::Role | FlowLogRoleCB27E7DF`: Resource handler returned message: "Policy arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/VPCFlowLogsDeliveryRolePolicy does not exist or is not attachable. (Service: Iam, Status Code: 404, Request ID: 8f8d39b7-b13e-423c-80ff-9ec9041b7ea9) (SDK Attempt Count: 1)"

2.  `CREATE_FAILED | AWS::EC2::EIP | TapVpcpublicSubnet1EIP45C8CEBC`: Resource handler returned message: "The maximum number of addresses has been reached. (Service: Ec2, Status Code: 400, Request ID: 76b24c35-67b4-490e-a97f-10fcad832ed7) (SDK Attempt Count: 1)"

Please fix these issues.
