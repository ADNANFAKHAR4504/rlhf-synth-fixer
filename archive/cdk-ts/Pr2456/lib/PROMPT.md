We’re doing this in AWS CDK with TypeScript, deploying to us-east-1. Keep the project tight and predictable: three files only — bin/tap.ts (app + region), lib/tap-stack.ts (all resources), and cdk.json (project config). When the model replies, it should return only the code for those three files — no explanations, no comments, nothing extra.

What we need is a small serverless stack: a Node.js Lambda that’s invoked by an HTTP endpoint on API Gateway, CORS enabled for all origins. The function should run with a timeout no greater than 15 seconds and pick up runtime configuration via environment variables. Give it least-privilege IAM permissions to write to a DynamoDB table. That table uses on-demand capacity and a single string primary key called id. We also want an S3 bucket for function logs — simplest path is to provision the bucket, grant the function write access, and pass the bucket name via env var so the function can drop its own logs there (don’t rely on comments or manual steps). Apply a global tag Environment: Production across everything.

Everything must target us-east-1, synth and deploy cleanly with CDK/CloudFormation, and satisfy the constraints above. Return only the code for bin/tap.ts, lib/tap-stack.ts, and cdk.json
