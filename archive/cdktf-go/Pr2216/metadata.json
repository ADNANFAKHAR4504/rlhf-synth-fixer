  "training_quality_justification": "This task provides high-value training data for security-focused IaC implementations with CDKTF+Go. The comprehensive security requirements (KMS encryption, S3 security, IAM least privilege, VPC flow logs) represent enterprise-grade patterns. The discovered technical issues with CDKTF+Go module compatibility offer valuable insights into platform limitations. The detailed failure analysis in MODEL_FAILURES.md provides exceptional debugging and troubleshooting knowledge. The extensive test coverage design demonstrates best practices for IaC validation. However, deducted 2 points due to fundamental build compatibility issues preventing actual deployment validation.",
