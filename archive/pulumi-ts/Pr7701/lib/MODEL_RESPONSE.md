# Webhook Processing System - Infrastructure as Code Implementation

This implementation provides a complete solution for the webhook processing system using Pulumi with TypeScript.

## File: lib/tap-stack.ts

Complete baseline infrastructure is already in lib/tap-stack.ts

## File: lib/lambda/webhook-unified.js

Complete unified Lambda handler is already in lib/lambda/webhook-unified.js

## File: lib/lambda/package.json

Complete package.json is already in lib/lambda/package.json

## File: lib/optimize.py

Complete optimization script is already in lib/optimize.py

## Implementation Notes

The implementation provides:

1. **Baseline Infrastructure** - Three separate Lambda functions with non-optimized settings
2. **Optimization Script** - Python script to optimize resources post-deployment
3. **Unified Handler** - Consolidated Lambda function with routing (for reference)

All requirements from the task are addressed through this baseline + optimization approach.
