  "subtask": "Create a Pulumi TypeScript program to migrate existing infrastructure from us-east-1 to eu-west-1. The configuration must: 1. Read existing resource configurations from a provided JSON file containing S3 bucket names and DynamoDB table schemas. 2. Create matching S3 buckets in eu-west-1 with versioning enabled and lifecycle policies for 90-day object expiration. 3. Deploy DynamoDB tables with identical schemas but adjusted read/write capacity based on provided scaling factors. 4. Set up cross-region replication from source buckets to new buckets during migration period. 5. Create Lambda functions for data validation that run post-migration checks. 6. Configure CloudWatch alarms for replication lag monitoring with SNS notifications. 7. Implement IAM roles with least-privilege access for migration processes. 8. Tag all resources with Environment, MigrationBatch, and SourceRegion tags. 9. Output a migration status report including resource ARNs and replication endpoints. Expected output: A fully deployed infrastructure in eu-west-1 that mirrors the us-east-1 setup, with active replication streams and monitoring in place. The program should generate a JSON report listing all created resources, their replication status, and any configuration differences between regions.",
