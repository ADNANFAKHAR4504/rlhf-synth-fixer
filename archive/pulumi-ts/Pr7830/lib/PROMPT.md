# CI/CD Pipeline Integration

> **⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: This task MUST be implemented using pulumi with ts**
>
> Platform: **pulumi**
> Language: **ts**
> Region: **us-east-1**
>
> **Do not substitute or change the platform or language.** All infrastructure code must be written using the specified platform and language combination.

## Problem Statement

Create a Pulumi TypeScript program to provision a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. The configuration must:

1. Create an S3 bucket to store build artifacts with versioning enabled and lifecycle rules to delete artifacts older than 30 days.

2. Set up a CodeBuild project that uses the aws/codebuild/standard:5.0 image to build a Node.js application.

3. Configure the CodeBuild project with environment variables for NODE_ENV (production) and BUILD_NUMBER (using CODEBUILD_BUILD_NUMBER).

4. Create a CodePipeline with three stages: Source (from S3), Build (using CodeBuild), and Deploy (to another S3 bucket).

5. Implement IAM roles with least-privilege policies for CodeBuild and CodePipeline services.

6. Configure CloudWatch Logs for CodeBuild with a retention period of 7 days.

7. Add tags to all resources with Environment: production and ManagedBy: pulumi.

8. Enable encryption at rest for all S3 buckets using AWS managed keys.

9. Set up build notifications to CloudWatch Events for failed builds.

10. Configure the pipeline to automatically trigger when new source artifacts are uploaded to the source S3 bucket.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Platform Requirements
- Use pulumi as the IaC framework
- All code must be written in ts
- Follow pulumi best practices for resource organization
- Ensure all resources use the `environmentSuffix` variable for naming

### Security and Compliance
- Implement encryption at rest for all data stores using AWS KMS
- Enable encryption in transit using TLS/SSL
- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and policies
- Enable logging and monitoring using CloudWatch
- Tag all resources appropriately

### Testing
- Write unit tests with good coverage
- Integration tests must validate end-to-end workflows using deployed resources
- Load test outputs from `cfn-outputs/flat-outputs.json`

### Resource Management
- Infrastructure should be fully destroyable for CI/CD workflows
- **Important**: Secrets should be fetched from existing Secrets Manager entries, not created
- Avoid DeletionPolicy: Retain unless required

## Deployment Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Resource Naming
- **MANDATORY**: All named resources MUST include `environmentSuffix` in their names
- Pattern: `{resource-name}-${environmentSuffix}` or `{resource-name}-${props.environmentSuffix}`
- Examples:
  - S3 Bucket: `my-bucket-${environmentSuffix}`
  - Lambda Function: `my-function-${environmentSuffix}`
  - DynamoDB Table: `my-table-${environmentSuffix}`
- **Validation**: Every resource with a `name`, `bucketName`, `functionName`, `tableName`, `roleName`, `queueName`, `topicName`, `streamName`, `clusterName`, or `dbInstanceIdentifier` property MUST include environmentSuffix

### Resource Lifecycle
- **MANDATORY**: All resources MUST be destroyable after testing
- **FORBIDDEN**:
  - `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN` (CDK/CDKTF) → Use `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` instead
  - `DeletionPolicy: Retain` (CloudFormation) → Remove or use `Delete`
  - `deletionProtection: true` (RDS, DynamoDB) → Use `deletionProtection: false`
  - `skip_final_snapshot: false` (RDS) → Use `skip_final_snapshot: true`
- **Rationale**: CI/CD needs to clean up resources after testing

### AWS Service-Specific Requirements

#### GuardDuty
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT create GuardDuty detectors in code
- GuardDuty allows only ONE detector per AWS account/region
- If task requires GuardDuty, add comment: "GuardDuty should be enabled manually at account level"

#### AWS Config
- **CRITICAL**: If creating AWS Config roles, use correct managed policy:
  - ✅ CORRECT: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWS_ConfigRole`
  - ❌ WRONG: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/ConfigRole`
  - ❌ WRONG: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWS_ConfigRole`
- **Alternative**: Use service-linked role `AWSServiceRoleForConfig` (auto-created)

#### Lambda Functions
- **Node.js 18.x+**: Do NOT use `require('aws-sdk')` - AWS SDK v2 not available
  - ✅ Use AWS SDK v3: `import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'`
  - ✅ Or extract data from event object directly
- **Reserved Concurrency**: Avoid setting `reservedConcurrentExecutions` unless required
  - If required, use low values (1-5) to avoid account limit issues

#### CloudWatch Synthetics
- **CRITICAL**: Use current runtime version
  - ✅ CORRECT: `synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_7_0`
  - ❌ WRONG: `SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_5_1` (deprecated)

#### RDS Databases
- **Prefer**: Aurora Serverless v2 (faster provisioning, auto-scaling)
- **If Multi-AZ required**: Set `backup_retention_period = 1` (minimum) and `skip_final_snapshot = true`
- **Note**: Multi-AZ RDS takes 20-30 minutes to provision

#### NAT Gateways
- **Cost Warning**: NAT Gateways cost ~$32/month each
- **Prefer**: VPC Endpoints for S3, DynamoDB (free)
- **If NAT required**: Create only 1 NAT Gateway (not per AZ) for synthetic tasks

### Hardcoded Values (FORBIDDEN)
- **DO NOT** hardcode:
  - Environment names: `prod-`, `dev-`, `stage-`, `production`, `development`, `staging`
  - Account IDs: `123456789012`, `arn:aws:.*:.*:account`
  - Regions: Hardcoded `us-east-1` or `us-west-2` in resource names (use variables)
- **USE**: Environment variables, context values, or parameters instead

### Cross-Resource References
- Ensure all resource references use proper ARNs or resource objects
- Verify dependencies are explicit (use `DependsOn` in CloudFormation, `dependsOn` in CDK)
- Test that referenced resources exist before use

## Target Region
Deploy all resources to: **us-east-1**

## Success Criteria
- Infrastructure deploys successfully
- All security and compliance constraints are met
- Tests pass successfully
- Resources are properly tagged and named with environmentSuffix
- Infrastructure can be cleanly destroyed
