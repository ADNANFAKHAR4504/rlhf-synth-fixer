Please design and implement a highly available, secure, and maintainable serverless application using Pulumi with Python. The application should adhere to the following requirements:

- Use AWS Lambda functions with Python 3.8 runtime to provide compute services.
- Trigger Lambda functions via Amazon API Gateway endpoints exposed over HTTP.
- Store all logs generated by Lambda and the application in versioned Amazon S3 buckets.
- Enable AWS CloudWatch monitoring for Lambda invocations, error rates, and operational metrics.
- Ensure Lambda functions auto-scale automatically based on incoming traffic and request load.
- Configure strict IAM roles with least privilege to grant the minimum necessary permissions to each AWS service involved.
- Deploy all resources in the us-east-1 region.
- Implement infrastructure-as-code fully using Pulumi Python code, replacing CloudFormation JSON templates.
- Architect the deployment for high availability with minimal downtime, leveraging AWS managed services capabilities.
- Structure the Pulumi Python code to be modular, reusable, and well-documented for maintainability.

Keep the code clean and organized.
