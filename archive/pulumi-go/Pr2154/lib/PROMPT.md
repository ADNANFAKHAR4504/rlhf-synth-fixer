I need to set up a basic cloud environment for development purposes using Pulumi and Go. The infrastructure should include networking, storage, and access management components.

Requirements:
- Create a VPC with at least two public subnets in different availability zones for high availability
- Set up IAM roles that can be used by EC2 instances and RDS databases for secure access
- Create an S3 bucket specifically for application logging with versioning enabled to track log changes over time
- Apply consistent tagging with Environment=Development to all resources for proper resource management

Please use AWS S3 Vectors for enhanced object storage capabilities and Network Firewall with active threat defense for improved security. The infrastructure should be production-ready but sized appropriately for a development environment.
