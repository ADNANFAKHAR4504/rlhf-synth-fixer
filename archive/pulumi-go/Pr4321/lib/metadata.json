  "training_quality_justification": "High training value (8/10). The implementation demonstrates critical AWS service evolution patterns, particularly the S3 ACL configuration changes that reflect recent AWS security improvements. The MODEL_FAILURES.md documents 2 critical failures (S3 bucket ACL configuration and Firehose DataFormatConversionConfiguration) and 3 medium failures that provide valuable learning data. The task implements a complete PCI DSS-compliant data pipeline with proper encryption, monitoring, and security controls. Key learning opportunities include: KMS key policies for multi-service access, S3 bucket ownership controls for logging, Kinesis-Firehose integration with encryption, least privilege IAM policies, and CloudWatch monitoring setup. The fixes demonstrate proper Pulumi dependency management and error handling. Minor deductions: test coverage at 75% (below 90% target), some integration test path resolution issues documented."
