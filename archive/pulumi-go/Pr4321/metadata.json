  "training_quality_justification": "High training value (8/10). The implementation required fixes for critical AWS service constraints: (1) S3 ACL configuration with recent AWS ownership controls changes, (2) Kinesis Firehose DataFormatConversionConfiguration validation requirements, and (3) resource conflict management. These represent real-world AWS API changes and best practices for Pulumi dependency management. All requirements from the PROMPT were successfully implemented including: data ingestion with Kinesis Streams, secure storage with S3 and KMS encryption, Firehose delivery pipeline, least privilege IAM policies, comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring, and PCI-DSS compliance features. The platform (pulumi) and language (go) match metadata.json requirements. Minor deduction (-2) due to incomplete test coverage (75% vs 90% target) and need for manual cleanup between deployments.",
