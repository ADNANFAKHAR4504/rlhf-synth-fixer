  "problem": "Design infrastructure for a healthcare application with the following requirements: 1. Utilize AWS KMS to encrypt all S3 buckets to secure data at rest, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. 2. Store all sensitive credentials such as passwords in AWS Secrets Manager to maintain security best practices. 3. Deploy resources in the us-west-2 region, with proper tagging including 'Project: HealthApp' and 'Environment: Production' for visibility and management. 4. The infrastructure must support updating without replacement of critical resources.",
