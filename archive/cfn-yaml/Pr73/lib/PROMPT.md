You are an expert AWS Solutions Architect specializing in CloudFormation for enterprise-level infrastructure deployment. Your task is to design a robust and consistent CloudFormation stack that adheres to strict organizational standards, including cross-region deployment, centralized configuration management, fine-grained access control, standardized tagging, and strong encryption.

Your CloudFormation template must be written in YAML and address the following critical requirements, focusing on robust design patterns for enterprise-level consistency and security:

1.  **Multi-Region Deployment Readiness:** The template should be designed to be deployable in two different AWS regions, leveraging parameters for region-specific configurations where necessary.
2.  **Dynamic Configuration Management with AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:** Utilize AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to retrieve and manage environment-specific configurations (e.g., VPC IDs, subnet IDs, security group IDs, specific S3 bucket names, KMS Key ARNs) dynamically. This ensures that the same template can be used across different environments (e.g., Dev, Prod) and regions without modification to the template itself.
3.  **Strict S3 Access Control (VPC Restriction):** Implement S3 bucket policies that *explicitly restrict access* to the buckets solely from specified VPCs within the same region. This will require defining VPC Endpoint resources for S3 in the VPCs and incorporating `aws:SourceVpc` or `aws:SourceVpce` conditions in the S3 bucket policies. Clearly demonstrate how the S3 bucket policy enforces this restriction.
4.  **Standardized Resource Tagging:** Ensure that all deployable resources within the stack include consistent tagging. Each resource must be tagged with `costCenter` and `environment` tags. Define these tags as parameters to allow for dynamic assignment during stack deployment.
5.  **Application Load Balancer (ALB) Configuration:** If an ALB is part of the infrastructure (e.g., if EC2 instances or containers are deployed), explicitly configure it to utilize **cross-zone load balancing capabilities**. Even if explicit EC2/container resources aren't in the initial scope, assume that an ALB will be provisioned to support future application deployments and show how this cross-zone setting would be applied.
6.  **KMS Encryption for S3 Data:** Configure all S3 buckets within the stack to enforce server-side encryption using customer-managed AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. The KMS Key should be provisioned by the template, and its ARN should be used for the S3 bucket encryption settings.
7.  **Least Privilege IAM Roles:** Define IAM Roles and policies for any services that require permissions to interact with other AWS resources (e.g., an EC2 instance role, a Lambda execution role, or a CloudFormation service role). These policies must strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary actions on specific resources (using ARNs where appropriate).

**Your Expected Output:**

Provide a complete, well-commented YAML-based CloudFormation template that, upon successful deployment, will illustrate the creation of the specified resources, the configuration of load balancer capabilities (even if a placeholder), the implementation of strict S3 access restrictions (including the necessary VPC endpoint and S3 bucket policy), the standardized tagging across resources, the KMS encryption for S3, and the definition of least-privilege IAM roles.

**Note:** For demonstration purposes, you may include placeholder resources (e.g., a simple EC2 instance, a basic ALB) to illustrate the application of the requirements (tagging, security groups, KMS encryption, cross-zone load balancing). Focus on the mechanisms of interaction and policy enforcement rather than a full-blown application deployment.
