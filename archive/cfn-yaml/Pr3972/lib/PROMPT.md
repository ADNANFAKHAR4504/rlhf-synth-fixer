A startup needs to manage 1,500 daily customer records securely and efficiently. The system must ensure high data durability, enable automated backups, and remain cost-effective.

Create a database deployment using CloudFormation with:

    •	RDS MySQL for relational data storage
    •	Automated backups with a 7-day retention policy
    •	Private subnets (10.0.10.0/24) for secure network isolation
    •	KMS for data encryption at rest
    •	CloudWatch for database performance monitoring
    •	IAM for controlled and secure access management
