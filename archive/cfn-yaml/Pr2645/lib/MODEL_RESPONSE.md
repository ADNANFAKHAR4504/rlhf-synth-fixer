The stack provisions a multi-AZ VPC with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones and an internet-facing Application Load Balancer with HTTPS. It sets up CloudTrail with a multi-region trail that writes to S3 and CloudWatch Logs using KMS, and attaches AWS WAF to the ALB. An RDS instance is also created with encryption and automated backups. Shield Advanced is enabled to protect the ALB. For compute, an Auto Scaling Group behind the ALB serves the application. The S3 buckets deny insecure transport and block all public access by policy. IAM includes a cross-account role with MFA for auditors. The template exports all relevant ARNs, including the ALB listener and WAF WebACL.

Parameters cover environment naming, CIDR ranges, and SSL certificate ARN for the ALB HTTPS listener. The instance AMI is hardcoded to an Amazon Linux image ID. Subnets map correctly to AZs a and b. The CloudWatch alarms include 5xx errors from the ALB and high latency metrics.
