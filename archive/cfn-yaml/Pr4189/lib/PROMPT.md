Create a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure for a web application using CloudFormation in YAML. The infrastructure should include a VPC with public and private subnets, where an EC2 instance is deployed in the private subnet with an IAM role that has limited S3 access. Security groups must allow inbound SSH access only from a specified IP range. All resources should follow the naming convention projectName-environment-resourceName and include tags for Project, Owner, and Environment. S3 buckets must be encrypted using AWS KMS keys. Implement Auto Scaling for the application in the public subnet, use CloudFront with SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS traffic, and configure CloudWatch alarms to monitor EC2 CPU utilization. Additionally, deploy an RDS instance in the private subnet using a dedicated database subnet group. The output should be a validated CloudFormation YAML template that can be deployed without errors.
