Build three subnet tiers (public for ALBs/NAT, private for app workloads, database with no internet routing) across three AZs; attach an Internet Gateway; create per-AZ NAT Gateways using dedicated Elastic IPs; define explicit route tables and associations per tier; harden database subnets with NACL rules that explicitly deny SSH from public CIDRs; add gateway VPC endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB on private and database route tables; enable VPC Flow Logs to a CloudWatch Logs group (1-minute aggregation) using an IAM role; and apply consistent Environment/Team/CostCenter tagging and environment-suffix naming for safe multi-environment deployments.",
