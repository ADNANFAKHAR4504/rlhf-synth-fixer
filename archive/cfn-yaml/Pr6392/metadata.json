The stack provisions KMS-encrypted S3 buckets with Object Lock (Compliance mode), versioning, lifecycle transitions to Glacier, and cross-region replication. It includes per-region KMS keys, IAM roles for replication, least-privilege policies, and optional CloudWatch monitoring (alarms, dashboards, SNS notifications). The template ensures data durability, compliance retention, VPC endpoint–restricted access, and automated replication metrics for operational resilience across us-east-1 and us-west-2.",
