I need a CloudFormation template that sets up a secure and scalable web application environment in AWS us-east-1. The template should create a VPC with two public and two private subnets across different Availability Zones. Public subnets must have an internet gateway, while each private subnet should use a NAT gateway for outbound internet access. Security groups need to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic only on the public side, with private subnets restricted to internal communication.

Inside the private subnets, I want an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances defined by a launch template that uses the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Traffic should be routed through an Application Load Balancer with HTTPS enabled via an AWS-managed certificate. CloudWatch alarms must monitor CPU utilization and automatically adjust capacity based on the demand.

Additionally, I want all logs stored in a centralized S3 bucket with versioning enabled. Every resource should follow consistent tagging for environment and ownership. The output should be a single YAML CloudFormation template that fully provisions these components following AWS best practices for security, high availability, and cost-effective scaling.
