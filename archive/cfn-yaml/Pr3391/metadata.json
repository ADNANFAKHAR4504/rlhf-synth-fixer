  "training_quality": 7,
  "training_quality_justification": "This task provides high-quality training data for disaster recovery infrastructure implementation. The PROMPT is comprehensive and clearly defines enterprise-grade DR requirements for financial services with specific RTO/RPO targets. The MODEL_RESPONSE provides a detailed CloudFormation template, though it had significant gaps (missing Aurora Global Database, Auto Scaling, Route 53 health checks). The IDEAL_RESPONSE addresses many of these issues with proper implementations. The MODEL_FAILURES.md document thoroughly analyzes 10 major categories of issues with detailed explanations, making this excellent training material for understanding common DR infrastructure mistakes and their resolutions. The task demonstrates complex multi-region architecture, security best practices, and compliance requirements, making it valuable for teaching IaC patterns for highly available and disaster-resilient systems. The training value is reduced slightly (7/10 instead of 9-10) because the IDEAL_RESPONSE still uses simplified RDS instead of full Aurora Global Database implementation, showing the complete solution wasn't achieved.",
