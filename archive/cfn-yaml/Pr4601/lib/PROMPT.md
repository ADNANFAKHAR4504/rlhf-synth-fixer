Create a secure multi-region AWS environment using CloudFormation in YAML format that adheres to strict security and compliance standards. The environment should be deployed across us-east-1 and eu-west-1 regions and include configurations to ensure all S3 buckets are encrypted using AES-256, RDS instances are encrypted with AWS-managed KMS keys, and all sensitive logs are encrypted at rest. Use IAM roles to manage permissions instead of attaching policies directly to users and activate multi-factor authentication for the root account. Configure CloudTrail to capture all management events, use AWS Config to monitor and track changes to security groups, and enforce strong password policies across all accounts. Ensure EC2 instances are launched with least privilege security groups and implement a VPC with a Web Application Firewall to protect against common web threats. The output should be a validated CloudFormation YAML template that meets all security requirements and passes a comprehensive compliance audit.
