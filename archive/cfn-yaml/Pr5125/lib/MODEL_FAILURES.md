**model_failure**

* Introduces non-existent or incorrect resources (e.g., WAF, Shield Advanced, Firehose, NACLs, dashboards, additional Lambdas).
* Contains long, tool-like paragraphs without concise bullet structuring.
* Includes tables, code snippets, or pseudo-command examples not permitted by the requirements.
* Uses robotic or overly formal tone instead of human-authored clarity.
* Lists parameters or architectural elements missing from the actual template.
* Misrepresents stack scope by adding extra services or omitting real ones (e.g., missing Config or GuardDuty).
* Creates structural inconsistencies, making it look AI-generated or over-engineered.
* Does not follow section order or clarity expected for professional IaC documentation.
* Fails to align with the original YAML structure or user’s explicit constraints.
