Build everything new with ENVIRONMENT_SUFFIX-based naming and encryption-by-default. Configure KMS-backed CloudWatch Log Groups, metric filters for business KPIs, Synthetics canary checks, anomaly detectors, and Contributor Insights. Enable X-Ray tracing, composite alarms with SNS actions (local and optional central), and an EventBridge remediation path. Publish a multi-panel CloudWatch Dashboard and optional OAM Link for cross-account visibility—aligned with least-privilege IAM and production best practices.",
