Create a single CloudFormation template that orchestrates a comprehensive web application infrastructure designed to meet enterprise grade requirements for scalability, security and high availability. The infrastructure should seamlessly integrate multiple AWS services to form a cohesive architecture that can automatically respond to demand fluctuations and maintain service availability even during component failures.

The architecture needs to establish a multi tier network foundation using a VPC that segregates resources across public and private subnets spanning at least two availability zones, ensuring both network isolation and redundancy. Within this network, you'll need to implement an Application Load Balancer that intelligently distributes incoming traffic across a fleet of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling group, which should dynamically adjust capacity based on demand metrics. The application tier must connect to a highly available database layer using Amazon RDS configured with Multi AZ deployment to provide automatic failover capabilities and data durability.

Security considerations are paramount throughout the design, requiring you to implement defense in depth strategies through properly configured security groups and network ACLs that restrict access to authorized IP ranges only. The application components need an IAM role with precisely scoped permissions to interact with S3 for object storage, RDS for database operations  and CloudWatch for monitoring capabilities. All data at rest in S3 must be protected using server side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and the entire infrastructure must maintain comprehensive audit trails by forwarding all logs to CloudWatch Logs for centralized monitoring and compliance reporting.

To ensure organizational standards and operational consistency, every resource within the template must adhere to a strict naming convention following the pattern <project>-<environment>-<resource-type>, where you should use 'webapp' as the project name and 'prod' as the environment designation. The template should be region agnostic, allowing deployment to any AWS region without modification, while maintaining all functional and security requirements.

Your CloudFormation template should be production ready, following AWS best practices for infrastructure as code, including proper parameter usage for customization, outputs for resource discovery and metadata for documentation. The final YAML template should be syntactically valid, pass CloudFormation validation  and be immediately deployable to create a fully functional, secure and scalable web application infrastructure.
