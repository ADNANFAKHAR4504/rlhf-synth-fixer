  "background": "Provision a production-grade monitoring and observability stack for a distributed payment processing platform in us-east-1 using a single TapStack.yml. The stack creates CloudWatch log groups and metric filters over JSON application, VPC, and function logs; emits custom metrics; and renders live dashboards with 60-second views. Alarms and composite alarms use metric math for health scoring, with SNS email/SMS alerting. EventBridge routes alarm state changes to a remediation Lambda. Saved Logs Insights queries, metric streams to durable storage via Firehose/S3, Synthetics canaries for API checks, and flow/contributor insights provide deep troubleshooting and compliance-grade visibility. All resources are newly created, environment-suffixed, and parameterized for safe, repeatable deployments.",
