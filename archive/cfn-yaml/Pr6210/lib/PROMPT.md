Develop a CloudFormation YAML template that deploys an automated security analysis system to audit existing AWS infrastructure for compliance and best practices. The system should define a Lambda function that inspects CloudFormation stack resources and performs checks on IAM roles, S3 buckets, RDS instances, and security groups. It should identify overly permissive IAM policies, ensure S3 buckets have public access blocked and encryption enabled, and verify that RDS instances have automated backups with at least seven days of retention. The Lambda function should also detect any security group rules allowing unrestricted access from 0.0.0.0/0 on sensitive ports. Create custom resources to trigger the Lambda analysis, and store the generated compliance reports in an S3 bucket with findings categorized by severity. Include CloudWatch alarms that activate when critical violations are detected, and use CloudFormation parameters to specify the target stacks for analysis. The template should output the S3 location of the compliance report and provide summary statistics of the audit results. The final solution must be deployable in the us-east-1 region and provide a structured, automated, and repeatable mechanism to evaluate AWS security compliance.
