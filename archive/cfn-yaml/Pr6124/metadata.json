  "background": "Deploy a secure, production-grade baseline in us-east-1 using a single TapStack.yml. The stack provisions networking (VPC with public/private subnets, Internet/NAT gateways, routes, and security groups), identity (IAM roles/policies/users and account password policy), and encryption (KMS key). It creates versioned, KMS-encrypted S3 buckets with restrictive bucket policies, enables AWS Config (recorder and delivery channel), and delivers CloudTrail logs to S3. Data services include an RDS instance with a DB subnet group. An API layer is provided via API Gateway (REST API, deployment, and stage) protected by a WAF WebACL and association. Compute is automated via an EC2 Launch Template and Auto Scaling Group, with operational visibility through CloudWatch alarms and notifications via SNS topics/subscriptions. The goal is a self-contained, repeatable environment aligned to production hardening and consistent tagging/naming conventions.",
