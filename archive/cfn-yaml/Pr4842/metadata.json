The stack provisions a VPC with subnets, Internet Gateway, and routing; an EC2 instance secured with IAM roles and security groups; a KMS-encrypted S3 bucket that stores CloudTrail logs; and integrates CloudWatch Alarms and SNS notifications for monitoring and alerting. The environment must follow least-privilege IAM, encryption best practices, and consistent tagging for auditing and scalability.",
