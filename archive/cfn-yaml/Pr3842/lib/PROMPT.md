Serverless API using AWS CloudFormation with YAML in a single file

A startup needs to handle 2,000 daily user requests efficiently. The system must be serverless, secure, and include basic usage tracking for insights.

Create a serverless API using CloudFormation with:

    •	API Gateway for managing endpoints
    •	Lambda (Python 3.10) for request processing
    •	DynamoDB for storing user data
    •	CloudWatch for metrics and monitoring
    •	Parameter Store for configuration management
    •	IAM for secure access control
