Create a secure, scalable, and highly available web application infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation written in YAML. The application should be deployed across two AWS regions, us-east-1 and us-west-2, using existing VPCs with CIDR blocks 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.1.0.0/16. Implement an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple availability zones and use an Auto Scaling group to dynamically manage EC2 instances based on traffic demand. Store application assets and logs in S3 with versioning and access controls enabled, and ensure all data transfer is secured with HTTPS using AWS ACM certificates. Configure Route 53 for DNS routing across both regions and integrate CloudFront to deliver cached static content efficiently. Use CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, DynamoDB for session management, and AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage sensitive information. All IAM roles must follow the principle of least privilege, and only the public Load Balancer should be accessible externally. The output should be a validated CloudFormation YAML file named web_app_deployment.yaml that successfully provisions all resources according to best security and availability practices.
