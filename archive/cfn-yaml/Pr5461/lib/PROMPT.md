Create a secure and scalable AWS production environment using CloudFormation in YAML format following best practices for security, compliance, and availability. The infrastructure should include a VPC with properly configured public and private subnets across two availability zones in the US East N. Virginia region, ensuring all EC2 instances are deployed within this VPC and follow restricted SSH access rules. Implement IAM roles with least privilege permissions and enforce encryption for all data at rest and in transit using AWS KMS with key rotation enabled. Configure an Auto Scaling Group maintaining at least three EC2 instances and integrate CloudWatch alarms for performance and scaling monitoring. Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute HTTP and HTTPS traffic, and deploy RDS instances in a multi-AZ configuration with encryption enabled. Ensure CloudTrail is active for logging and auditing all API activity, and use AWS Config to identify and report non-compliant resources. Store logs in an encrypted S3 bucket with versioning enabled and handle sensitive configuration data securely through AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Tag all resources with Environment, Owner, and Project, and establish automated daily backups and patch management for EC2 instances. The output should be a validated CloudFormation YAML template that deploys successfully and complies with AWS security and compliance standards.
