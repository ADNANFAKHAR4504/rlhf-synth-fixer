# Model Response

The model has generated an updated CloudFormation template that strengthens the environment's security posture while resolving previous deployment issues.  
The solution implements encryption, IAM least-privilege policies, CloudTrail with compliant S3 policies, VPC isolation, subnet routing, NAT, WAF integration, and Secrets Manager-based RDS authentication.  
It also fixes naming violations, avoids unsupported patterns, removes early-validation failures, and ensures global uniqueness across all S3 resources.  
This response provides a stable and deployable version of the template aligned with AWS best practices and the requirements defined in the prompt.
