Create a single CloudFormation template that establishes a foundational AWS infrastructure for a development team preparing to deploy a web application.  The infrastructure should begin with a VPC configured with the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block, providing ample address space for future expansion while maintaining a clear network boundary for your resources.

Within this VPC, you'll need to architect a public subnet using the 10.0.1.0/24 address range that will host your web facing resources. This subnet requires proper internet connectivity, which means establishing an Internet Gateway and configuring the necessary routing infrastructure to ensure traffic can flow between your subnet and the public internet. The routing configuration should associate a route table with your public subnet, directing all non local traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the Internet Gateway you've attached to the VPC.

Security is paramount in this setup, so you must implement a security group that acts as a virtual firewall for your instances. This security group should permit inbound SSH access on port 22 for administrative purposes and HTTP traffic on port 80 for web services, both from any source IP address (0.0.0.0/0) to facilitate testing.  Also apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only the necessary ports are opened and that egress rules are appropriately configured.

For the compute layer, provision a t2.micro EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 within your public subnet. This instance must be configured with a public IP address to allow direct internet access and should utilize the security group you've defined. The instance requires proper identification through tagging specifically, it should be named 'WebServerInstance' and tagged with 'Environment=Testing' to clearly indicate its purpose in your infrastructure taxonomy. Additionally, ensure that SSH key pair management is properly configured to enable secure administrative access to the instance.

The final deliverable should be a production ready CloudFormation template that can be validated and deployed without modification, creating a fully functional AWS environment that meets all specified requirements while maintaining security and operational best practices.
