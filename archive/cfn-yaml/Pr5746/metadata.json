The stack must provision from scratch with zero external dependencies and enforce a zero-trust posture across IAM (least privilege, permission boundaries, cross-account access with ExternalId), KMS CMKs (automatic rotation, MFA-guarded administration) for S3/RDS/EBS, encrypted S3 buckets with TLS-only and unencrypted-upload denials, Secrets Manager with 30-day rotation plus SSM Parameter Store dynamic references, CloudWatch log groups encrypted with KMS and 365-day retention, and AWS Config compliance rules bootstrapped idempotently. Include clearly parameterized environment suffixing for all resource names, regional guardrails (us-east-1/us-west-2), comprehensive tagging for audit/compliance, and outputs for key ARNs/IDs to support downstream integration and automated tests.",
