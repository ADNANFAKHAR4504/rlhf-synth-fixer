Serverless Workout Log Processing System using AWS CloudFormation with YAML (single file)

A fitness app needs to handle 3,000 daily workout logs efficiently. The system must be serverless, provide basic metrics, and ensure secure, scalable processing for user-generated data.

Create a processing system using CloudFormation with:

    •	AWS Lambda (Python 3.10) for handling and processing workout logs
    •	Amazon DynamoDB (with auto-scaling) for storing workout data
    •	Amazon API Gateway to expose secure endpoints for app integration
    •	Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and performance metrics
    •	AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration management
    •	AWS IAM for secure, least-privilege access control
