Create a single CloudFormation template that addresses a critical infrastructure migration scenario for a growing e-commerce platform experiencing rapid user growth. Our company's web application currently serves millions of users daily and the executive team has mandated a complete infrastructure overhaul to ensure 99.99% uptime while maintaining strict security compliance standards. The application architecture consists of static content delivery for product images and JavaScript assets, combined with a dynamic backend handling user sessions, shopping carts and payment processing.

The infrastructure you're designing must seamlessly integrate multiple AWS services to create a fault tolerant, scalable ecosystem. Begin by establishing a VPC that spans three availability zones in the deployment region, implementing both public and private subnet tiers to properly segregate your resources based on their exposure requirements. Your static content delivery strategy should use an S3 bucket with versioning capabilities to maintain historical copies of all assets, while a CloudFront distribution acts as the global content delivery network, ensuring sub second load times for users worldwide. This CloudFront distribution requires HTTPS-only communication using a custom SSL certificate provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager, as the security team has identified unencrypted traffic as a critical vulnerability.

For the dynamic components, implement an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances distributed across multiple availability zones, with traffic intelligently routed through an Elastic Load Balancer. These instances need carefully crafted Security Groups that restrict incoming traffic to ports 80 and 443 exclusively. The database layer should consist of an RDS instance positioned within private subnets, configured with a seven day automated backup retention policy to meet disaster recovery requirements. The EC2 instances require an IAM role granting them appropriate access to read from the S3 bucket and write to CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging.

Monitoring and alerting form a crucial part of this infrastructure, so implement CloudWatch Alarms that track CPU utilization across the Auto Scaling group, triggering scaling events when thresholds are breached. DNS management should be handled through Route 53, creating the necessary record sets to direct traffic to your CloudFront distribution. Throughout the template, ensure all resources are tagged with Name, Environment and Owner tags to facilitate cost tracking and resource management. The template should accept parameters for customizing instance types, database sizes and environment names, allowing the same template to be used across development, staging and production environments.

Your final deliverable should be a comprehensive YAML CloudFormation template that can be deployed without errors, creating a production ready infrastructure that balances performance, security and cost efficiency while adhering to AWS best practices for high availability architectures.
