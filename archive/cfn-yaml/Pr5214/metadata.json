  "background": "Deploy a production-ready, serverless TapStack environment in us-east-1 using a single CloudFormation template (TapStack.yml). The stack creates a VPC with two public and two private subnets across AZs, an Internet Gateway, optional NAT Gateways, and an S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint. It provisions two S3 buckets (ingest and artifacts) with versioning, SSE-S3 encryption, TLS-only access, and lifecycle transitions; a DynamoDB ResultsTable using a customer-managed KMS CMK and autoscaling; and a KMS key plus alias for application encryption. Two Lambda functions (TransformFunction and ApiHandlerFunction) run in private subnets behind a security group, with CloudWatch log groups and alarms. EventBridge triggers TransformFunction on S3 ObjectCreated events. An API Gateway REST API exposes the ApiHandlerFunction with a versioned stage. Cognito (User Pool, Client, Identity Pool) enables authentication, and an SNS topic with email subscription handles developer alerts. Parameters cover environment suffix, Lambda runtime/memory/timeout, DeveloperAlertEmail, and API stage; outputs publish key resource IDs/ARNs/URLs for integration.",
