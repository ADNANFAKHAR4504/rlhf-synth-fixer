IDEAL_RESPONSE demonstrates comprehensive CloudFormation implementation with security best practices, proper IAM policies, CloudWatch monitoring, custom resources for S3 notifications, and complete error handling. MODEL_RESPONSE shows a basic, flawed implementation with security issues (overly broad IAM permissions), circular dependencies, missing components (SNS, CloudWatch), and deployment problems. This provides strong training contrast between poor and excellent implementations.",
