Create a KMS key that encrypts data stored in Systems Manager Parameter Store for database credentials. IAM roles for developer and operations teams connect to the KMS key through least-privilege policies with boundary restrictions. CloudWatch Log Groups receive encrypted audit trails using the KMS key with 90-day retention. SNS topic integrates with CloudWatch and IAM roles to send security alerts using KMS encryption. Service-linked roles for AWS Config connect to CloudTrail for audit logging.

Set up cross-account trust relationships where IAM roles in this account connect to a central security account 123456789012 through assume role policies. All IAM roles enforce MFA for delete operations on critical resources. IAM password policy requires 14 character minimum with complexity rules.

Each IAM role policy explicitly grants specific actions on defined resources - no wildcard permissions. Developer role connects to CloudWatch Logs for read access, Systems Manager parameters for read-only access, and limited S3 operations on specific bucket paths. Operations role connects to CloudWatch for write operations, Systems Manager for parameter updates, and SNS for alert publishing.

KMS key policy grants encrypt/decrypt permissions to Systems Manager service principal for parameter encryption, CloudWatch Logs service principal for log encryption, and SNS service principal for topic encryption. IAM user groups connect team members to their respective roles through group policy attachments and instance profiles for EC2 access.

Deliver a complete YAML CloudFormation template TapStack.yml with ENVIRONMENT_SUFFIX parameter for dynamic resource naming. Use CloudFormation intrinsic functions to reference resources by logical ID, ensuring proper dependency chains between KMS key creation, IAM policy attachment, and service configurations. Output the KMS key ARN, IAM role ARNs, CloudWatch log group names, and SNS topic ARN for cross-stack references. Tag all resources with Environment, Owner, and Classification for compliance tracking.
