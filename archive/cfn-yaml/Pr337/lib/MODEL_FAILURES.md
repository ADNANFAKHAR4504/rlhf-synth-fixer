Nova’s response, while similar in structure and intent, falls short in several key areas compared to the first. It lacks comprehensive region support in the Mappings section (only including us-west-2), making it less flexible for multi-region deployments. It also does not dynamically derive the availability zones using !Sub '${AWS::Region}a' syntax, instead hardcoding them (us-west-2a and us-west-2b), reducing portability. Nova’s template removes important elements like the EC2 KeyPair creation resource, CloudWatch alarms for Auto Scaling and RDS monitoring, Application Load Balancer, Target Group, Listener, Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template and dynamic scaling policies—all of which are present in the first response, making it more robust and production-ready. Furthermore, outputs like ALBDNSName, RDSEndpoint, and KeyPairParameterPath are also missing, which are crucial for integration and post-deployment automation. Overall, the first template provides a more secure, scalable, and monitorable infrastructure suitable for production use.
