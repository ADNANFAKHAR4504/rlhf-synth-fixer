  "background": "Deploy a brand-new, self-contained serverless transaction processing stack in us-east-1 using a single TapStack.yml. Provision an S3 bucket with versioning and a 90-day lifecycle policy that triggers a Python 3.11 ingestion Lambda on uploads/ *.csv. Persist validated transactions into a DynamoDB table (partition key transactionId, sort key timestamp) with on-demand billing, streams (NEW_IMAGE), and point-in-time recovery. Wire a fraud detection Lambda to the DynamoDB stream to publish alerts (amount > 10000) to an SNS topic with an email subscription for compliance. Provide a REST API in API Gateway with GET/POST endpoints and a usage plan (API key, 1000 requests/day). Include an SQS DLQ (max receive count 3) for Lambdas, least-privilege IAM roles, X-Ray tracing for all Lambdas and API Gateway, CloudWatch metric-math alarms for >1% error rate over 5 minutes, explicit 30-day log retention, and outputs for S3 bucket name, API base URL, and DynamoDB table ARN. All resource names include EnvironmentSuffix for safe multi-environment deployments.",
