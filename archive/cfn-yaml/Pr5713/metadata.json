Enable GuardDuty with S3 protection and EKS audit logs, route only MEDIUM/HIGH findings via EventBridge to a Lambda enricher, publish alerts to an SNS topic with email subscription, and store enriched events in a versioned S3 audit bucket with AES256 encryption and blocked public access. Include an EventBridge archive for 90-day retention, least-privilege IAM roles and policies with explicit ARNs, and a CloudWatch log group for the Lambda with 30-day retention. All resource names include an environment suffix and the template exports key outputs for downstream integration.",
