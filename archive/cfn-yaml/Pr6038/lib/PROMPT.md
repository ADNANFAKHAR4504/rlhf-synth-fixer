You are a senior infrastructure engineer at a fintech startup that needs to deploy their customer portal web application on AWS. The application consists of a React frontend (served separately, not part of this infrastructure) and a Node.js API backend that processes payment transactions and stores sensitive customer data in a PostgreSQL database. 

Create a single CloudFormation template in YAML format that deploys the complete infrastructure stack to the us-east-1 region. The infrastructure must span across two availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Your networking architecture should establish a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 containing two public subnets (10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24) and two private subnets (10.0.10.0/24 and 10.0.20.0/24), each pair distributed across different availability zones. The public subnets will host an Application Load Balancer and NAT gateways, while the private subnets will contain the application servers and database instances. Configure an Internet Gateway for the VPC and ensure proper route tables are established so that backend API instances in private subnets can reach the internet only through NAT gateways, maintaining the constraint that backend instances must not have direct internet access.

For the application layer, deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnets with an HTTPS listener on port 443. This listener must use an AWS Certificate Manager certificate for SSL/TLS termination. The load balancer should forward traffic to a target group containing your Node.js API servers. These API servers should run on t3.medium EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling group configured with a minimum of 2 instances, maximum of 6 instances, and desired capacity of 3 instances. Implement target tracking scaling based on CPU utilization with a target value of 70%. The Auto Scaling group must deploy instances exclusively in the private subnets using a launch template that includes user data to install and start the Node.js application.

For data persistence, provision an RDS PostgreSQL 13.7 instance with Multi-AZ deployment enabled for high availability. Use db.t3.medium instance class with 100GB of allocated storage. The database must be deployed in the private subnets using a dedicated DB subnet group. Following the security requirement, the RDS master password must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic password generation, and the template should reference this secret using CloudFormation dynamic references. Enable automated backups with a 7-day retention period.

Implement a comprehensive security group strategy where the ALB security group allows HTTPS traffic (port 443) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0), the EC2 instance security group permits HTTP traffic (port 80) exclusively from the ALB security group, and the RDS security group allows PostgreSQL connections (port 5432) only from the EC2 security group. This creates a secure, layered network architecture appropriate for handling financial data.

Configure Route 53 to create an A record for the domain api.fintech-portal.com that aliases to the Application Load Balancer, enabling users to access the API through a friendly domain name rather than the ALB's auto-generated DNS name.

For operational visibility, establish CloudWatch alarms to monitor critical metrics. Create an alarm for ALB UnHealthyHostCount that triggers when unhealthy targets exceed a threshold of 1, and another alarm for Auto Scaling group CPU utilization that alerts when average CPU usage exceeds 80%. Both alarms should publish to an SNS topic for notification delivery.

The template should include parameters for customizable values such as environment name, instance types, and key pair names to enable reusability across different deployment scenarios. Implement a consistent tagging strategy across all resources with tags for Environment, Application, and Owner. Use CloudFormation intrinsic functions like !Ref, !GetAtt, !Sub, and !Join appropriately throughout the template for dynamic resource referencing and string manipulation.

Your deliverable should be a single, production-ready CloudFormation YAML template that can be deployed directly to AWS without modifications, passes CloudFormation validation, and demonstrates best practices for infrastructure-as-code in a high-stakes financial services environment.
