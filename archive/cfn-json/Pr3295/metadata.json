  "training_quality_justification": "High training value (8/10) due to: (1) Complex multi-service RDS infrastructure requiring 8 critical production fixes (environment suffix, deletion policies, resource naming), (2) Real-world deployment challenges with S3 naming conventions and KMS integration, (3) Comprehensive security implementation (network isolation, encryption, IAM roles), (4) Production-ready monitoring with 5 CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications, (5) Advanced features like Performance Insights, enhanced monitoring, lifecycle policies. The MODEL_FAILURES document provides valuable learning on deployment blockers and AWS service constraints. Strong candidate for training on production-ready database infrastructure patterns.",
