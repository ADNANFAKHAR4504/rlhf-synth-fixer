Develop a CloudFormation template in JSON format to set up a production-ready cloud infrastructure in AWS. Create a Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and define two public subnets in different availability zones to ensure high availability. Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC and configure a route table that routes all outbound traffic from the public subnets to the Internet Gateway for external connectivity. Set up a security group that permits inbound HTTP traffic on port 80 and HTTPS traffic on port 443 from any source to allow web access. Launch an EC2 instance in each public subnet using the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI and assign public IP addresses to all EC2 instances to make them accessible over the internet. Implement CloudWatch alarms to enable an auto-start and stop mechanism for the EC2 instances based on CPU utilization metrics. Tag all created resources with the key Environment and the value Production for proper resource identification and management. Deploy all infrastructure components in the us-west-1 region following AWS CloudFormation best practices for infrastructure as code.
