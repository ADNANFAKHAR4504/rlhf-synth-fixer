  "training_quality_justification": "This task provides high-quality training data (8/10) for several reasons: (1) It covers a comprehensive, production-ready AWS infrastructure with 12+ services requiring proper integration, (2) The MODEL_FAILURES.md identifies 8 critical issues including database engine mismatch (MySQL vs PostgreSQL), LaunchTemplate version handling, Secrets Manager implementation, and S3 logging configuration - all common real-world errors, (3) The IDEAL_RESPONSE demonstrates proper CloudFormation patterns including KMS key rotation, S3 event notifications to Lambda, proper OAI configuration with CanonicalUser, and environment-based naming conventions, (4) Security best practices are extensively covered (encryption at rest/in transit, least privilege IAM, private subnets, security groups), and (5) The fixes address both blocker-level infrastructure failures and architectural improvements. The task complexity and the substantial corrections needed make this valuable for training on secure, scalable infrastructure patterns.",
