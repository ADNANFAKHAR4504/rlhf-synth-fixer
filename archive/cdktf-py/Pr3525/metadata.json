  "training_quality_justification": "High training value (8.5/10): The MODEL_RESPONSE contained multiple CDKTF-specific errors including incorrect class names (S3BucketVersioning vs S3BucketVersioningA), mixed parameter naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase), incorrect API Gateway integration structure, and Lambda initialization issues. These are valuable learning examples for CDKTF Python implementation. The fixes demonstrate proper CDKTF provider usage, resource separation patterns, and Python best practices. The comprehensive nature of corrections across infrastructure code, Lambda functions, and testing provides substantial training data for improving model knowledge in serverless CDKTF implementations.",
