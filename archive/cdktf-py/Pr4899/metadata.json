  "training_quality_justification": "Score 8/10: High training value from 32 distinct issues fixed across 8 categories. Critical CDKTF provider type system quirks (8 occurrences) - boolean/string and integer/string mismatches that are non-obvious. Import error with non-existent class requiring provider API knowledge. Route table inline configuration not supported in CDKTF requiring separate Route resources (CDKTF abstraction differences). API Gateway dependency chain issues. Missing operational stack outputs (13 added). Integration test methodology corrections (7 tests). Real deployment issues discovered beyond synthesis. High complexity streaming platform with 16+ AWS services, Multi-AZ, auto-scaling, encryption, and monitoring. Core design was architecturally sound with 100% requirements compliance. Training value comes from CDKTF-specific lessons, provider quirks, operational maturity, and production-ready considerations rather than fundamental design flaws.",
