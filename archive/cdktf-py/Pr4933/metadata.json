  "training_quality_justification": "MODEL_RESPONSE provided working prototype but required 5 significant production enhancements: comprehensive monitoring/alerting infrastructure, advanced ECS configuration with DLQ and auto-scaling, enhanced dual-AZ networking, database backup/encryption configuration, and Kinesis enhanced metrics/encryption. Model demonstrated core service understanding but missed critical production patterns. CDKTF syntax error in capacity provider configuration (critical fix) shows learning opportunity. Excellent training value for production-readiness patterns.",
