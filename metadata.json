  "background": "A Brazilian fintech company needs to process credit card transactions in real-time while maintaining PCI-DSS compliance. The solution must handle peak loads of 10,000 transactions per second, store encrypted transaction data, and provide audit trails for compliance purposes.",
  "problem": "Design and implement a PCI-DSS compliant real-time financial transaction processing pipeline using Pulumi with Go. The system must handle credit card transaction data, encrypt it in transit and at rest, and provide scalable processing capabilities with high availability in the sa-east-1 region.",
  "constraints": "All resources must be deployed in eu-central-2 region; All data must be encrypted at rest using KMS keys and in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher; System must maintain high availability with multi-AZ deployment and automatic failover; Infrastructure must be compliant with PCI-DSS requirements for network segmentation and access controls",
