Base score 8 + 4 Category A significant fixes (VPC/networking, secrets integration, security violations, KMS rotation) +2 points, capped at +2. Complexity bonus: multiple services (RDS, VPC, KMS, Secrets Manager) +1, security best practices (encryption, IAM, private access) +1, high availability (multi-AZ capable) +1, capped at +2 total complexity. Final: 8 + 2 + 2 = 12, reduced to 9 accounting for some implementation being removed (Lambda rotation function). Significant learning opportunity on production networking, security best practices, and compliance-driven architecture."
