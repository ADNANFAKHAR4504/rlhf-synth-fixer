    "All infrastructure must be defined in Pulumi Go",
    "Use IAM roles and policies to enforce least privilege access",
    "Ensure all data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS",
    "Implement VPC with at least 2 public and 2 private subnets across two availability zones",
    "Use AWS Lambda functions to process data from S3 with strict timeout and memory settings",
    "All Lambda functions must use environment variables to pass sensitive data securely",
    "Enable versioning for all S3 buckets used",
    "Set up CloudWatch alarms for any unauthorized access attempts or resource usage spikes",
    "Ensure all communications are over HTTPS using ACM for TLS certificates",
    "Apply security groups that deny all inbound traffic except from specific IP ranges",
    "Include detailed tagging for all resources to assist in cost tracking and management"
