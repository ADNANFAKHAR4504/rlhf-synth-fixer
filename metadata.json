The current Pulumi infrastructure code creates database instances without proper optimization, leading to high costs and slow query response times.",
  "environment": {
    "description": "AWS infrastructure deployed in us-east-1 region with RDS MySQL 8.0 instances in private subnets across 3 availability zones. The environment includes VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, private subnet IDs subnet-0abc123, subnet-0def456, subnet-0ghi789. Existing security group sg-db-mysql-prod allows MySQL traffic from application subnets. Requires Pulumi 3.x with Python 3.9+, AWS provider v6.x configured. CloudWatch monitoring enabled for all database metrics with SNS topic arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:db-alerts for alarm notifications."

  "problem_statement": "Create a Pulumi Python program to optimize an existing RDS MySQL infrastructure by fixing performance and cost issues. The configuration must: 1. Create an RDS MySQL 8.0 instance with instance class db.t4g.large. 2. Configure GP3 storage with 100GB initial size, 3000 IOPS, and 125 MB/s throughput. 3. Create a custom parameter group with performance_schema=ON and slow_query_log=ON. 4. Enable automated backups with 7-day retention and preferred window 03:00-04:00 UTC. 5. Configure Multi-AZ deployment based on an input parameter 'is_production' (boolean). 6. Create CloudWatch alarms for CPU utilization > 80% and free storage < 10GB. 7. Enable deletion protection only when is_production is true. 8. Use existing subnet group 'db-subnet-group-prod' for database placement. 9. Apply tags Environment=production, CostCenter=payments, and OptimizedBy=pulumi. 10. Export the database endpoint, port, and resource ID for application configuration. Expected output: The program should create an optimized RDS instance with improved performance settings, cost-effective instance sizing, and proper monitoring. All CloudWatch alarms should send notifications to the existing SNS topic for operational alerts.",
