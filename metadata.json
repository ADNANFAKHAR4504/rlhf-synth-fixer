  "training_quality": 7,
  "training_quality_justification": "The implementation demonstrates strong HIPAA-compliant healthcare infrastructure with proper security controls and monitoring. Training value is good (7/10) because: (1) Required 3 significant fixes during QA (environment suffixes, password constraints, secrets rotation) indicating the model needs improvement on multi-environment deployment patterns and AWS service constraints; (2) Excellent coverage of complex integration patterns including Aurora Serverless v2, Container Insights enhanced observability, and comprehensive security configuration; (3) MODEL_FAILURES.md provides detailed documentation of issues and fixes; (4) Code properly implements all core requirements but needed refinement for production readiness. Score is not higher due to the critical fixes needed for basic deployment functionality."
