  "background": "A software development team needs to implement a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline for deploying Pulumi-based AWS infrastructure. The pipeline must support automated testing, security scanning, and staged deployments with proper environment separation. The solution requires both a GitHub Actions workflow for orchestration and Pulumi Python code for AWS resource provisioning.",
  "environment": "AWS CI/CD infrastructure deployed in us-east-1 region. The solution uses GitHub Actions as the CI/CD orchestrator to run Pulumi deployments. The Pulumi Python program provisions AWS resources including CodePipeline, CodeBuild, ECR, S3, SNS, and IAM roles. Requires Pulumi CLI 3.x with Python 3.9+, boto3 installed. Pipeline integrates with GitHub for source control using OIDC-based AWS authentication.",
  "mandatory_constraints": [
    "GitHub Actions workflow must trigger only on commits to 'main' and 'release/*' branches",
    "All IAM roles must follow principle of least privilege with explicit resource ARNs",
    "Both GitHub Actions workflow and CodePipeline must have exactly 5 stages: Source, Build, Test, SecurityScan, and Deploy",
    "Use Pulumi ComponentResource pattern to organize related AWS resources"

  "optional_constraints": [
    "All artifacts must be encrypted using a customer-managed KMS key",
    "CodeBuild projects must use compute type BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL for cost optimization",
    "Pipeline notifications must be sent to SNS topic only for failed executions",
    "GitHub Actions must use OIDC-based AWS authentication via role assumption",
    "Security scan stage should use Bandit for Python code analysis and Safety for dependency vulnerabilities"
